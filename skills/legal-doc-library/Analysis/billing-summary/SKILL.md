## Privilege and Billing Safeguards

- **Protect privilege**: never include legal advice, mental impressions, or litigation strategy.
- **Be specific**: avoid vague phrases like "legal research" — always name the topic.
- **Tie work to objectives**: connect entries to matter goals or compliance requirements.
- **Show policy compliance**: rates, caps, task codes, approved expenses.
- **Flag anomalies**: unusual expenses, staffing changes, large time spikes.
- **No duplicate billing**: do not overlap timekeeper entries for the same task without explanation.
- **No administrative padding**: exclude admin tasks unless guidelines permit.
- **Stay consistent**: narrative must match time entry descriptions and invoice totals.
