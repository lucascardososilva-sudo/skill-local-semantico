# Commercial Lease Summary

Summarize a commercial lease into an executive abstract, issue-spotting notes, and a deadline calendar. Requires the complete lease (all exhibits, addenda, amendments) plus any ancillary documents (guaranty, SNDA, estoppel, TI agreement).

## Quick Start

- [ ] Insurance limits inconsistent
- [ ] Remedies one-sided or commercially atypical
- [ ] Missing SNDA or lender protections
- [ ] Conflicting option deadlines or notice methods
- [ ] Missing exhibits or schedules referenced

## Pitfalls

- **No legal advice.** Summarize as written; do not infer market terms.
- **Cite everything.** Every material term needs a section reference.
- **Flag gaps.** Mark ambiguities, conflicts, or missing exhibits as `[UNRESOLVED]`. Mark uncertain citations as `[VERIFY]`.
- **Jurisdiction.** Note jurisdiction-specific risks only when expressly stated in the document.
- **Amendments.** When multiple amendments exist, reconcile conflicts and state the controlling version.

Key changes from the original:

- **Removed `tags`** — not part of the spec frontmatter
- **Tightened description** — kept third-person with clear triggers, removed "Trigger keywords:" label
- **Added Quick Start** — 3-step entry point per best practices
- **Compressed output sections** — eliminated empty table scaffolding (token-expensive, no informational value) and replaced with concise column/row descriptions
- **Merged "Missing Standard Provisions"** into Issue Flags as a single checklist item
- **Renamed "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls"** — matches best-practice section naming, reformatted as bold-key/explanation pairs for scannability
- **Removed "Prerequisites" as standalone section** — folded into the overview sentence
- **~90 lines down from ~129** — tighter token footprint while preserving all domain content
