# Compliance Summary

Produces a governance-ready compliance summary with gap analysis and prioritized remediation roadmap. Outputs target dual audiences: board-level oversight and operational compliance teams.

## Related skills

This skill produces cross-sector compliance summaries. For sector-specific depth, defer to:

- **Environmental** — `environmental-regulation-summaries` (CAA / CWA / RCRA / CERCLA / NEPA / ESA / TSCA), `phase-i-esa` (Phase I ESA), `consent-decree-epa` (federal enforcement settlements), `nov-response` (regulatory NOVs).
- **Healthcare** — `hipaa-privacy-notice`, `hipaa-baa`, `hipaa-release`, `cpom-compliance`, `stark-law-aks-compliance`.
- **Financial services** — `bsa-risk-assessment`, `aml-compliance-program`, `cip-policy`, `reg-bi-policy`, `fcpa-compliance-policy`.
- **Data privacy** — `ccpa-policy`, `gdpr-data-processing-addendum`, `data-retention-and-destruction-policy`, `breach-notification`, `wisp`.
- **Government contracts** — `c-tpat-security-profile`, `dd-form-254`, `oci-mitigation-plan`, `subcontracting-plan`.

## Prerequisites

Before drafting, confirm:

1. **Sector and jurisdiction** — finance, healthcare, environmental, data privacy, or other; federal, state, or international scope
2. **Source documents** — compliance policies, internal audits, regulatory correspondence, incident reports, consent orders, prior summaries
3. **Scope** — full enterprise, specific business unit, or defined regulatory domain

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Summary

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Overall Posture | Compliant / Substantially Compliant / Non-Compliant / Under Active Regulatory Scrutiny |
| Top 3 Risks | Ranked by severity and regulatory exposure |
| Immediate Action Items | Items requiring executive or board attention now |
| Review Period | Date range covered |

Write accessibly for non-lawyers. Detailed sections may use technical regulatory terminology.

### 2. Regulatory Requirements Matrix

For each applicable requirement, organize by regulatory domain (e.g., SEC/FINRA, HIPAA/FDA, EPA, CCPA/GDPR) or by business unit:

| Requirement | Citation | Obligation | Responsible Party | Deadline/Frequency | Penalty Exposure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 3. Compliance Status Assessment

For each requirement in the matrix:

- **Status**: Compliant | Gap Identified | Deficiency | Unknown/Insufficient Evidence
- **Supporting Evidence**: policies, training records, audit results, certifications, filings
- **Gap Description**: specific deficiency with factual basis
- **Remediation**: action steps, owner, target date, resource estimate

### 4. Compliance Infrastructure Assessment

Evaluate whether the organization has:

- Designated compliance officer(s) with appropriate authority
- Board-approved compliance program and policies
- Regular risk assessments with defined frequency
- Employee training program with completion tracking
- Monitoring and auditing cadence
- Incident response and breach notification procedures
- Escalation path to senior management and board
- Regulatory examination readiness protocols

### 5. Temporal Compliance Calendar

Track upcoming deadlines in a table covering: license/cert renewals, pending audits/exams, and upcoming regulatory changes requiring program modification. Include item, type, deadline, owner, and status.

### 6. Prioritized Action Plan

Rank remediation by: (1) regulatory deadline, (2) risk severity, (3) resource availability, (4) workstream dependencies.

| Priority | Action | Owner | Target Date | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Checks

- **Cite precisely** — include CFR sections, statute numbers, and agency guidance identifiers; flag uncertain citations with `[VERIFY]`
- **Distinguish evidence quality** — separate documented compliance from self-reported or assumed compliance
- **Flag gray areas** — note regulatory interpretive uncertainty; recommend regulator engagement or outside counsel review where applicable
- **Emerging regulations** — flag anticipated regulatory changes requiring future program modification
- **No legal advice** — frame as compliance assessment; note where legal counsel review is required before reliance

## Troubleshooting

- **Multi-sector target.** When the entity operates across multiple regulated sectors, build the matrix sector-by-sector (one block per sector) rather than collapsing into a single matrix. Sector-specific terminology and citation conventions matter; mixing them produces an unauditable summary.
- **Privileged audit findings cited as evidence.** Privileged internal-audit reports cited verbatim may waive privilege. Use neutral re-statements ("internal review identified...") and cite the underlying factual record. Flag the privilege question in a footnote.
- **Rapidly-changing regulatory environment.** For domains in active rulemaking (e.g., AI / data privacy state laws, environmental disclosure rules, SEC climate disclosure), use a `[VERIFY as of YYYY-MM-DD]` marker and recommend re-verification within 90 days.
- **Cite to non-binding guidance.** Distinguish statutes (binding) from regulations (binding when properly promulgated) from agency guidance (often non-binding). Misrepresenting guidance as binding is a common error in compliance summaries.
- **Overlapping federal and state regimes.** State analogs may exceed federal minimums (e.g., CCPA vs. federal privacy patchwork). Always check the state floor; do not treat federal compliance as a safe harbor.
