# Criminal Case Summary

2. Walk through each section below in order; mark inapplicable sections "Not applicable" with a brief reason.
3. Flag any unverified statute or procedural point with `[VERIFY]`.

## Pitfalls

- **Neutrality** — no advocacy or opinion; do not infer facts beyond the record.
- **Cite sources** — tie evidence and facts to specific counts; reference docket entries, transcripts, or exhibits.
- **Jurisdiction terminology** — respect variations (information vs. indictment, etc.).
- **`[VERIFY]` tag** — use on any uncertain statute citation or procedural point.
- **Privacy** — use initials for victims/witnesses when appropriate.
