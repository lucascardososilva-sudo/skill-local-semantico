# Discovery Document Summarization

Produces a structured summary of discovery materials with precise citations for trial preparation and case strategy. Applies regardless of which side the user represents.

## Prerequisites

- **Discovery documents** — interrogatory responses, RFP responses, RFA answers, deposition transcripts, produced documents
- **Case context** — claims, defenses, key issues, parties
- **Citation sources** — Bates ranges, response numbers, or transcript page:line references

## Quick Start

1. Identify discovery types present in the materials
2. Produce the four-part output structure below
3. Cite every factual assertion to a specific source

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview

3–5 paragraph narrative covering:

- Significant admissions or revelations
- Key documents or testimony
- Inconsistencies across responses
- Notable refusals, evasions, or privilege assertions
- Critical evidentiary gaps

### 2. Discovery Breakdown

Organize by discovery type or by claim/issue — whichever better serves the matter.

Per section, include a header block:

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Discovery Type | Interrogatories / RFP / RFA / Deposition |
| Requesting Party | {name} |
| Responding Party | {name} |
| Date(s) | {response date(s)} |

Then summarize:

- **Admissions** — quote or paraphrase with exact citation
- **Produced documents** — description, Bates range, relevance (1–2 sentences)
- **Objections** — type and whether it blocked material disclosure
- **Evasive/incomplete responses** — what specifically was avoided

### 3. Cross-Reference Analysis

| Topic/Fact | Source A (cite) | Source B (cite) | Consistent? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {fact} | {cite} | {cite} | Yes/No | {discrepancy detail} |

### 4. Outstanding Discovery Issues

- [ ] Incomplete responses requiring follow-up (list by response number)
- [ ] Objections warranting meet-and-confer or motion to compel
- [ ] New custodians or document sources identified in testimony
- [ ] Areas where supplemental requests are warranted
- [ ] Privilege log deficiencies

## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Cite everything** — every assertion needs a response number, Bates stamp, or page:line
- **Stay objective** — no legal conclusions; flag apparent evasion but let attorneys draw conclusions
- **Sufficient detail** — attorneys should be able to work from the summary without pulling underlying documents for routine tasks
- **Flag patterns** — systematic objection strategies, coordinated non-responses, recurring privilege claims
- **Navigation** — include a table of contents when materials span 3+ discovery categories or 10+ responses
