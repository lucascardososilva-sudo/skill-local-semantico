## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Neutrality**: No fairness analysis or advocacy language.
- **Precision**: Use exact figures, dates, and percentages from the agreement.
- **Gaps**: Flag missing data or cross-referenced schedules as "not provided."
- **Jurisdiction**: Note state-specific terms without redefining them; custody and support rules vary by state.
- **Citations**: Mark uncertain legal citations as `[VERIFY]`.
