# Elder Law Summary

Structured legal overview for elderly client matters — jurisdiction-specific analysis across all elder law domains with a prioritized action plan. Serves both legal professionals and family caregivers.

## Prerequisites

Gather before generating:

1. **Client profile** — age, state, capacity status, living situation
2. **Legal documents** — wills, trusts, POAs, advance directives, guardianship orders
3. **Financials** — asset inventory, income sources, benefit status (Medicare/Medicaid/SSI)
4. **Medical context** — conditions, care needs, current arrangements
5. **Triggers** — suspected abuse, Medicaid application, capacity decline, family disputes

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview

| Element | Content |
|---|---|
| Client snapshot | Name, age, state, capacity status, living situation |
| Critical issues | Top 3–5 pressing legal concerns |
| Immediate actions | Time-sensitive items (deadlines, reporting obligations) |
| Risk level | Low / Moderate / High with justification |

### 2. Domain Analysis

Analyze each applicable domain:

**Estate Planning** — Inventory documents; note execution defects, staleness, missing instruments. Identify untitled assets, missing beneficiary designations, outdated fiduciaries. Recommend specific documents to draft/update.

**Elder Abuse** — Flag suspicious transactions, undue influence signs, neglect markers. State-specific mandatory reporting rules and applicable agencies. Remedies: protective orders, civil claims, criminal referrals, APS reporting.

**Healthcare Rights & Advance Directives** — Directive validity and consistency with current wishes. Medicare/Medicaid enrollment and eligibility issues. Nursing home residents' rights, HIPAA considerations.

**Medicaid & Long-Term Care** — State-specific income/asset eligibility limits. Look-back period (60 months; 30 months California pre-2024 `[VERIFY]`); flag disqualifying transfers. Spousal protections, exempt assets, permissible planning tools. Verify regulatory compliance.

**Guardianship / Conservatorship** — Assess necessity vs. less restrictive alternatives (POA, representative payee, supported decision-making). Jurisdiction-specific filing requirements, costs, timelines. Review existing order scope and reporting compliance.

**Benefits & Income** — Social Security, SSI, pension, veteran's benefits. Tax implications of current arrangements.

### 3. Document Review Findings

When documents are uploaded:

| Document | Key Facts | Red Flags | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| {name} | {dates, parties, terms} | {concerns} | Valid / Defective / Stale |

### 4. Prioritized Action Plan

| Priority | Action | Owner | Urgency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Immediate | e.g., file APS report | Attorney | 24–48 hrs |
| Short-term | e.g., update POA | Attorney + family | 2–4 weeks |
| Long-term | e.g., Medicaid pre-planning | Attorney + advisor | 3–6 months |

## Pitfalls & Checks

- **Always specify state** — Medicaid thresholds, guardianship procedures, and abuse reporting vary dramatically by jurisdiction
- **Plain language** — explain legal concepts accessibly; output serves attorneys and family caregivers
- **Cite uploaded documents** by name when identifying facts or concerns
- **Capacity observations only** — note concerns without clinical determinations; recommend formal evaluation where appropriate
- **`[VERIFY]` tag** — mark any statutory cite or threshold not confirmed against current law
- **Least restrictive alternative** — frame recommendations to preserve client autonomy and dignity
- **Include state contacts** where actionable (APS hotline, state Medicaid office, long-term care ombudsman)
