# Estate Administration Summary

Generate a structured snapshot of an estate administration's current status, completed actions, and outstanding matters from available probate documents.

## Prerequisites

1. Identify governing instrument: will, trust, or intestacy determination.
2. Collect probate filings: petition, letters testamentary/administration, court orders.
3. Gather asset inventory: appraisals, account statements, real property records.
4. Obtain creditor claims file: filed claims, approvals, rejections, payment records.
5. Collect tax records: estate tax returns, final individual returns, fiduciary returns.
6. Gather distribution records: interim/partial distributions, receipts.
7. Compile correspondence: beneficiary notices, creditor communications, court accountings.

## Guidelines

- Cite specific source documents for all factual assertions.
- Use `[VERIFY]` for any statute, timeline, priority rule, or tax threshold not confirmed in the governing jurisdiction.
- Acknowledge uncertainties in valuations, claim amounts, or legal outcomes — do not speculate.
- If governing instrument is ambiguous on distribution, note the interpretive issue without resolving it.
- Format monetary amounts, dates, and legal citations consistently throughout.
- Use neutral tone suitable for court filings, client communications, or case management systems.
- End every output with: "General legal information only; not legal advice. Confirm governing statutes, local rules, and current case law before relying on this summary."
