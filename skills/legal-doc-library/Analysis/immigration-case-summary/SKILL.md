# Immigration Case Summary

Summarizes an immigration matter into a scan-ready brief of facts, law, posture, and outcome.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm availability of:

- Complete case file (filings, notices, decisions, transcripts, correspondence)
- Benefit/relief type (asylum, AOS, family-based, removal defense, appeal)
- Forum(s) (USCIS, EOIR/IJ, BIA, federal circuit, or mixed)
- Key dates (filing, RFE/NOID, interview/hearing, decisions, appeal deadlines)
- Confidentiality scope (redactions, sensitivity flags for trauma/medical/minors)

## Workflow

1. Identify benefit/relief and governing authority from the record
2. Extract applicant background and eligibility elements with cited evidence
3. Build chronological procedural timeline with agency/court actions
4. State current posture and deadlines; note risks and open items
5. Flag missing records or conflicts

## Pitfalls

- **Never invent citations.** Mark uncertain legal citations as `[VERIFY]`.
- **Distinguish forum standards.** USCIS, EOIR, BIA, and circuit courts apply different standards — note which applies.
- **Capture RFE/NOID/NTA details verbatim** when critical to posture.
- **Flag record conflicts** — cite both sources; do not resolve silently.
- **Maintain confidentiality** — omit sensitive details unless required for analysis.
