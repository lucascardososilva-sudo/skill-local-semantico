## Guidelines

- Use clear, neutral legal tone; avoid advocacy or conclusions not supported by sources.
- Cite the exact intake source for each fact; avoid unsourced paraphrase.
- Flag missing facts with `Unknown` and surface as follow-up questions.
- Call out potential conflicts and urgency without assuming outcomes.
- Keep dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and verify entity spellings against source documents.
- Scope to U.S. corporate governance intake; if non-U.S. issues appear, label as jurisdictional uncertainty.
