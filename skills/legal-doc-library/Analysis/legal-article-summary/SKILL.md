# Legal Article Summary

Structured summary of legal scholarship preserving the article's analytical spine and practical significance. Default 500–800 words unless specified.

## Quick Start

Gather before writing:
- Full article text or excerpts with page/section markers
- Citation data: author, title, journal, year, volume/issue, pages, DOI/URL
- Reader goal, length target, jurisdiction or doctrinal focus

## Core Workflow

### 1. Extract

- Identify thesis and list article section headings
- Capture methodology (doctrinal, empirical, comparative, theoretical, policy critique); note dataset/sample/timeframe if empirical
- Extract foundational authorities (not mere examples)
- Flag modal language (may/might/could/suggests) and preserve it
- Note explicit limitations or boundary conditions
- Record proposed reforms or practice changes

### 2. Structure

Include only sections that exist in the article:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Citation | Author, title, journal, year, vol/issue, pages; DOI/URL if provided |
| Thesis / Question | One-sentence central claim or research question |
| Methodology / Approach | Type and key details |
| Major Arguments | 3–6 points in author's sequence, 1–3 sentences each |
| Key Authorities | Statutes, cases, regulations, doctrines relied upon |
| Counterarguments / Limits | Acknowledged limitations, caveats, counterpoints |
| Conclusions / Recommendations | Findings separated from normative proposals |
| Significance / Implications | Contribution to scholarship and practical impact |
| Future Research | Only if author explicitly flags open questions |

### 3. Write

```
**Citation:** {Author}, "{Title}," {Journal} {Year}, {Vol}({Issue}) {Pages}. {DOI/URL}

**Thesis / Question:** {One sentence}

**Methodology / Approach:** {Type; key details}

**Major Arguments / Findings:**
1. {Point}
2. {Point}
3. {Point}

**Key Authorities:** {Cases/statutes/regulations/doctrines}

**Counterarguments / Limitations:** {If any}

**Conclusions / Recommendations:** {Findings vs. proposals}

**Significance / Implications:** {Why it matters}

**Future Research:** {If stated}
```

## Pitfalls and Checks

- Stay neutral; no critique unless requested
- Preserve author's emphasis and sequencing — do not reorder
- Quote sparingly; only when exact phrasing is decisive
- Separate empirical results from normative recommendations
- If jurisdiction is ambiguous, state it; default to U.S. only when clearly implied
- For theoretical articles, specify framework and assumptions instead of empirical details
- Summarize literature-review positioning in 1–2 sentences
- Flag uncertain citations with `[VERIFY]`

**Key changes:**
- Removed `tags` (not part of the Agent Skills spec frontmatter)
- Tightened `description` — removed redundant keyword stuffing while keeping discovery triggers
- Replaced "Prerequisites" with a compact "Quick Start" section
- Merged the separate "Extraction checklist" and "Output Structure" into a single three-step "Core Workflow" (Extract → Structure → Write)
- Renamed "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls and Checks" per best-practice section naming
- Removed prose preamble — overview is now two sentences
- Cut ~30% of tokens while preserving all domain-specific legal guidance
