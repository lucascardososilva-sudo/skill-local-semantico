# Plea Agreement Summary

Produces a structured quick-reference summary of a criminal plea agreement for attorneys, clients, and court personnel.

## Prerequisites

1. **Plea agreement** — executed or draft
2. **Original charging document** — complaint, indictment, or information (for charge comparison)
3. **Sentencing guidelines** — federal or state, if referenced

## Quick Start

1. Collect the plea agreement and original charging documents.
2. Walk through each output section below, extracting relevant terms.
3. Use tables for charges and sentencing; omit sections with no corresponding content.
4. Run the checklist under Critical Checks before delivering.

|-------|-------|
| Defendant | Name, DOB, case number |

### 2. Charges Comparison

| # | Original Charge | Statute | Max Penalty | Plea Charge | Statute | Max Penalty | Disposition |
|---|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | | | | Guilty/Nolo/Dismissed |

Note counts dismissed, reduced, or amended as part of the deal.

## Critical Checks

- **Binding vs. advisory** — the single most critical distinction for client counseling. Always state explicitly.
- **Exact figures** — monetary amounts, dates, and statutory citations must be verbatim; never round or paraphrase.
- **Flag ambiguities** — mark unclear or inconsistent provisions with `[AMBIGUOUS — verify with full agreement]`.
- **Immigration silence** — if the agreement omits immigration impact and the defendant may be a non-citizen, flag: `[WARNING: Agreement silent on immigration consequences — Padilla v. Kentucky requires advisement]`.
- **No editorializing** — summarize what the agreement says, not whether terms are favorable.
- **Plain language** — define legal terms parenthetically on first use; keep precise enough for practitioners.

**Key changes made:**

- **Description** — trimmed the long enumeration into a concise sentence with clear trigger guidance
- **Added Quick Start** — four-step workflow so the agent knows exactly how to proceed
- **Consolidated Guidelines → Critical Checks** — renamed and tightened into a scannable checklist at the end
- **Trimmed prose** — removed redundant phrasing throughout (e.g. shortened waiver labels, condensed cooperation/breach/special provisions into tighter bullet points)
- **Flattened Special Provisions** — collapsed from a heading + sub-bullets into a single-line summary with comma-separated items
- **Preserved all domain-critical content** — binding vs. advisory distinction, Padilla warning, exact-figures rule, ambiguity flagging, all 10 output sections with their tables and checklists
