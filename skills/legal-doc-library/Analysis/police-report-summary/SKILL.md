# Police Report Summary

Transforms police reports into structured, source-attributed summaries for rapid case assessment. Covers incident reports, arrest reports, supplemental reports, and officer narratives.

## Quick Start

1. Gather all police report documents and related records (dispatch logs, booking records, evidence logs)
2. Produce the output sections below in order
3. Source-attribute every factual assertion with page number and document name
4. Run the checks in "Pitfalls" before delivering

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Summary

Two to three sentences: incident type, date/location, key parties, outcome (arrest, citation, report only).

### 2. Incident Details

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Report/Case No. | |
| Date/Time | |
| Location | |
| Reporting Officer(s) | Name, badge no. |
| Offense/Incident Type | |
| Disposition | Arrest / citation / open / cleared |

### 3. Involved Parties

Per person:

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Name / DOB | |
| Role | Suspect / victim / witness / reporting party |
| Contact Info | As documented |
| Injuries | If any |
| Statements | Key quotes with page refs |

### 4. Chronological Narrative

- Reconstruct timeline from all reports, attributed by source and page
- Use exact timestamps where available
- Distinguish: officer observations, dispatch records, witness accounts, suspect statements

### 5. Evidence & Observations

| Item | Description | Chain of Custody Notes | Page Ref |
|---|---|---|---|

Include physical evidence, photos/video, and test results.

### 6. Officer Conclusions

Summarize officer opinions, probable cause statements, and recommended charges. Label as officer conclusions, not established facts.

### 7. Flags & Issues

- **Discrepancies** — contradictions within or between reports
- **Missing information** — documentation gaps, unexplained time lapses
- **Procedural issues** — Miranda, consent to search, chain of custody, warrant problems
- **Brady/exculpatory material** — evidence or statements favoring the defense or contradicting the prosecution's theory

## Pitfalls

- **Source-attribute everything** — page numbers and document names for every assertion
- **Preserve exact quotes** when language is legally significant
- **Fact vs. opinion** — clearly separate officer observations, officer conclusions, and third-party accounts
- **Cross-reference** multiple reports to surface variations and contradictions
- **Include all identifiers** — badge numbers, report numbers, case numbers, CAD numbers
- **Do not editorialize** — flag issues without arguing conclusions
- **Completeness over brevity** — include all material facts to reduce need to re-review originals

**Key changes from original:**

- **Removed `tags`** — not part of the Agent Skills spec (only `name` and `description` are valid frontmatter fields)
- **Tightened description** — still includes what/when trigger guidance, stays under 1024 chars
- **Added Quick Start** — 4-step workflow checklist for immediate orientation
- **Folded Prerequisites into Quick Start** — step 1 covers document gathering without a separate section
- **Condensed output templates** — removed redundant table row examples, trimmed prose around each section
- **Renamed "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls"** — aligns with the best-practices body structure (pitfalls/checks)
- **Reduced from 85 to ~72 lines** — tighter token footprint while preserving all domain-critical content
