# Regulatory Submission Summary

Produces a structured summary of a regulatory submission package, enabling reviewers to quickly assess purpose, scope, supporting evidence, and compliance posture.

## Prerequisites

1. Primary submission documents — application form, cover letter, filing type identification.
2. Supporting technical data — clinical trials, safety/efficacy studies, engineering analyses, environmental or economic assessments.
3. Manufacturing/operational documentation — quality control, facility info, process descriptions.
4. Labeling or public-facing materials — proposed labels, consumer disclosures, service descriptions.
5. Agency correspondence — pre-submission meeting minutes, prior feedback, deficiency responses.
6. Regulatory pathway identification — NDA, 510(k), ANDA, BLA, environmental permit, rate case, etc.

## Output Structure / Process

### 1. Executive Overview

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Submitting Entity | Name, address, contact |
| Regulatory Body | FDA, EPA, FCC, state PUC, etc. |
| Submission Type | NDA, 510(k), BLA, ANDA, EIS, rate case, etc. |
| Submission Date | Date filed or to be filed |
| Requested Action | Approval, clearance, permit, authorization |
| Regulatory Framework | Statutory/regulatory basis with specific citations |
| Expedited Pathways | Breakthrough, fast track, priority review, waivers (if any) |

### 2. Subject Matter Description

- Product/device/substance/service identification (names, classifications, compositions).
- Intended use, target population, or scope of authorized operations.
- Key identifiers (NDC, device class, CAS number, facility ID as applicable).

### 3. Supporting Evidence Summary

Map each regulatory criterion to the evidence submitted:

| Approval Criterion | Evidence Submitted | Key Findings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safety | Study type, N= | Primary endpoints, results |
| Efficacy / Performance | Study type, N= | Primary endpoints, results |
| Manufacturing Quality | CMC data, GMP compliance | Key controls, validation status |
| Environmental / Public Impact | Assessment type | Conclusions, mitigation measures |

- Report statistical results with effect sizes, confidence intervals, and p-values.
- Flag novel aspects, first-in-class designations, or areas lacking established pathways.

### 4. Compliance Strategy

- Applicable statutes and regulations (cite specific sections).
- Guidance documents relied upon.
- Pre-submission interactions and how agency feedback was incorporated.
- Basis for any waiver, exemption, or special designation requests.

### 5. Review Timeline

| Milestone | Expected Date/Timeframe |
| --- | --- |
| Filing/acceptance review | |
| Substantive review period | |
| Information request window | |
| Advisory committee (if applicable) | |
| Public comment period (if applicable) | |
| Target action date | |

### 6. Submission Package Inventory

Number and briefly describe each major attachment/appendix:

1. **Module/Volume X** — Description
2. **Appendix A** — Description

### 7. Compliance Assessment

- [ ] Submission completeness relative to regulatory checklist
- [ ] Gaps or areas likely to trigger information requests
- [ ] Conditions or limitations that may attach to approval
- [ ] Post-approval commitments (REMS, Phase IV, monitoring, reporting)
- [ ] Ongoing compliance obligations

## Guidelines

- Use precise regulatory terminology; cite specific CFR sections, USC provisions, or agency guidance by name and number.
- Mark any citation that cannot be verified from source materials with `[VERIFY]`.
- Distinguish statistically significant from clinically meaningful results.
- Label interpretive conclusions vs. factual statements from the submission.
- Maintain jurisdiction awareness — FDA, EPA, FCC, and state agencies have distinct frameworks; do not conflate.
- For FDA submissions, follow the CTD (Common Technical Document) module structure where applicable.
- Flag regulatory risk areas transparently; do not minimize uncertainties.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing pathway identification**: If the submission type is unclear, check the cover letter and application form first; flag ambiguity in the executive overview and mark `[VERIFY]`.
- **Incomplete evidence tables**: When study data is partial or not provided, note the gap explicitly rather than omitting the criterion row.
- **Multi-agency submissions**: If a product requires approval from multiple agencies (e.g., FDA + EPA), create separate executive overview and compliance strategy sections per agency.
- **Expedited pathway uncertainty**: If expedited designation status is claimed but not confirmed, note as "requested" vs. "granted" and mark `[VERIFY]`.

**Key changes from original:**

1. **Frontmatter**: Added `>-` multi-line description with explicit trigger keywords per spec; kept valid controlled-vocabulary tags.
2. **Section rename**: "Output Structure" → "Output Structure / Process" to match codebase convention (see `legal-research`, `client-advisory-summary`).
3. **Section rename**: "Review Process & Timeline" → "Review Timeline" (conciser).
4. **Added Troubleshooting section**: Required by the spec validation checklist but missing from the original.
5. **Trimmed prose**: Removed bracket placeholders from evidence table cells, tightened bullet formatting with terminal periods for consistency, removed the "Format for professional regulatory file inclusion" guideline (redundant with overall tone).
6. **Removed bold from prerequisite labels**: Aligns with the flat numbered-list style used in peer skills.
