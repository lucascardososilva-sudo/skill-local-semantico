# Contract Dispute Analysis Report

Produces an evidence-driven analysis for commercial contract disputes to support go/no-go litigation decisions.

## Prerequisites

1. **Agreement package** — main contract, exhibits, SOWs, amendments, riders, executed versions.
2. **Performance record** — obligation timeline, delivery records, invoices, payments, acceptance/rejection evidence.
3. **Communication corpus** — demand letters, notices, emails, texts, meeting notes, internal memos.
4. **Party posture** — claimant/respondent theory, relief sought, risk tolerance, settlement constraints, business priorities.
5. **Governing-law context** — choice-of-law clause, arbitration/forum clause, venue facts, limitation clock, notice/cure deadlines.

## Quick Start

1. Collect all documents listed in Prerequisites.
2. Run the Pre-flight checklist below to confirm completeness.
3. Follow Core Workflow steps 1–7 to produce each report section.
4. Populate all three matrices (Contract & Term, Breach, Remedies).
5. Deliver final report using the Output Structure.

## Output Structure

| # | Section | Output | Method |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Executive snapshot | 1-page assessment + recommendation | Summarize positions, merits, recommended path |
| 2 | Contract architecture | Parties, obligations, key clauses, ambiguities | Map duties, dependencies, enforcement gates (notice/cure/ADR) |
| 3 | Timeline and facts | Chronological event ledger | Tie events to contract duties and claimed breach |
| 4 | Breach/defense analysis | Claim-by-claim matrix | Evaluate materiality, causation, damages, counter-defenses |
| 5 | Governing law framework | Applicable law + forum + standards | Apply choice-of-law, conflicts analysis, jurisdictional authority |
| 6 | Remedies and risk | Damages scenarios + enforceability limits | Quantify recoverable vs. contested amounts and legal barriers |
| 7 | Strategy and next steps | Litigation/ADR/settlement options | Best/base/worst-case with triggers and timing |
| 8 | Final assessment | Decision-ready conclusion | Immediate actions and evidence priorities |

## Required Matrices

### Contract & term matrix

| Clause | Legal effect | Burden on parties | Risk flag | Missing evidence |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|

### Breach matrix

| Obligation | Alleged breach date | Supporting evidence | Materiality | Cure response | Counter-argument |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|

### Remedies matrix

| Remedy sought | Legal basis | Proof needed | Estimated amount | Limitation/defense risk |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|

## Core Workflow

1. **Validate document hierarchy** — identify contradictory provisions across contract versions.
2. **Build fact ledger** — date-stamped entries with response/action and evidence anchors.
3. **Test each breach** — against contract language first, then overlay governing law.
4. **Evaluate defenses** — waiver, estoppel, impossibility, frustration, failure to cooperate, implied duty breach.
5. **Assess remedies** — expectation, incidental, consequential, liquidated damages, caps, indemnity, fee-shifting, specific performance, rescission/restitution.
6. **Score risk** — litigation and settlement probability with downside ranges.
7. **Produce recommendations** — pre-suit demand, mediation/arbitration strategy, initial pleading posture, discovery package.

## Pre-flight Checklist

```
- [ ] All operative contract versions and amendments identified
- [ ] Notice and cure compliance tested against contract + statute
- [ ] Evidence gaps listed with impact on burden and damages
- [ ] Limitation/arbitration deadlines flagged with date source
- [ ] Confidentiality and privilege controls applied before sharing
```

## Guidelines

- Use numbered headings for fast review.
- Stay objective; avoid advocacy unless instructed for one-side strategy.
- **Do not fabricate** dates, values, or authority.
- Cite controlling law in Bluebook or jurisdiction-appropriate format.
- For goods contracts, evaluate UCC claims where relevant (e.g., UCC §§ 2-313, 2-714, 2-715) [VERIFY].
- Mark uncertain or contested authority with `[VERIFY]`.
- Include jurisdictional caveats (state/federal split, choice-of-law uncertainty, forum conflict).
- Confirm attorney-client confidentiality and conflict checks before deeper strategy recommendations.

**Key changes made:**

- **Description**: tightened to stay under 1024 chars, third-person, clear trigger list without the "Trigger keywords:" label
- **Added Quick Start** section per best practices (fast on-ramp)
- **Flattened structure**: removed the nested "Required templates" sub-subsections — promoted matrices to their own `## Required Matrices` section for scannability
- **Removed redundant "Output Structure / Process"** heading split — consolidated into a single clean table
- **Core Workflow**: promoted from `###` to `##`, bolded step labels with em-dash descriptions for faster scanning
- **Pre-flight Checklist**: moved into a fenced block per codebase workflow-pattern conventions
- **Fixed typo**: "rescission/restition" → "rescission/restitution"
- **Cut ~20% token weight** by trimming redundant phrasing in prerequisites, table cells, and guidelines while preserving all legal substance
- **Line count**: reduced from 82 to 78 lines, well under the 500-line ceiling
