# Executive Employment Agreement

Produces a negotiation-ready executive employment agreement aligned to term sheet, board approvals, and jurisdictional enforceability.

## Quick Start

Gather these inputs before drafting:

1. **Parties** — entity name, type, address; executive name and address
2. **Role** — title, reporting line, location, start date
3. **Compensation** — base salary, bonus, equity, benefits, perquisites, expenses
4. **Term and termination** — at-will vs. fixed; Cause/Good Reason definitions; notice/cure; severance; CIC treatment
5. **Governing law** — jurisdiction, dispute forum
6. **Equity plan** — plan name, award type, vesting schedule, award agreement
7. **Restrictive covenants** — jurisdictional limits, consideration, permitted scope

Flag any missing items before drafting.

## Core Workflow

1. **Extract terms** from supplied documents; list gaps
2. **Draft** using section order below with required defined terms
3. **Populate** compensation, termination, and covenant tables
4. **Run enforceability checks** — at-will consistency, covenant enforceability, 409A exposure
5. **Finalize** with signature blocks and notice addresses

| Option | Required Inputs |
|---|---|

| Litigation | Venue, jurisdiction, jury waiver |
| Mediation | Timing, provider, cost split |

### Mandatory Clauses

- Entire agreement; written amendments
- Severability and reformation (especially covenants)
- Assignment: permitted for Company, prohibited for Executive
- Notice method and addresses
- Withholding and tax compliance
- Section 409A compliance or exemption
- Injunctive relief for covenant breaches
- Counterparts and electronic signatures

## Pitfalls

- **At-will conflicts** — if at-will, state explicitly; ensure severance language does not create an implied term.
- **Missing terms** — flag and request specifics; never guess business terms or use placeholders.
- **Non-compete enforceability** — heavily jurisdiction-dependent; mark with `[VERIFY]` if state law is uncertain.
- **Equity conflicts** — defer to equity plan and award agreement; do not create conflicting terms.
- **409A exposure** — include safe-harbor language for any deferred compensation; use `[VERIFY]` for public issuers.
- **Severance conditions** — always condition on execution of release and continued covenant compliance.
- **Cause/Good Reason alignment** — match definitions to negotiated notice and cure periods.
- **Governing law consistency** — align with restrictive covenant enforceability strategy.

Key changes from the original:

- **Removed `tags`** — not part of the Agent Skills spec; only `name` and `description` are required frontmatter
- **Tightened description** — removed "Trigger keywords:" label; wove discovery terms naturally into the description
- **Restructured body** — follows the recommended Overview / Quick Start / Core Workflow / Pitfalls pattern
- **Consolidated Prerequisites into Quick Start** — same info, fewer tokens
- **Trimmed Termination Matrix** — removed Definition and Notice/Cure columns (redundant with the defined terms table)
- **Replaced empty Restrictive Covenant table** — the original had blank cells; replaced with a concise prose instruction
- **Renamed Guidelines to Pitfalls** — matches best-practice section naming; trimmed the "use consistent defined terms" guideline (obvious for any drafter)
- **Reduced from 127 to ~107 lines** — more token-efficient while preserving all domain accuracy and legal intent
