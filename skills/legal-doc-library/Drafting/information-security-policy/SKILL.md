# Information Security Policy

Drafts a formal Information Security Policy satisfying multi-framework regulatory requirements with enforceable operational guidance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Org profile** — industry sector, employee count, jurisdictions of operation
2. **Regulatory triggers** — applicable frameworks (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, GLBA, FERPA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF)
3. **Existing governance docs** — current policies, data classification schemes, incident response plans
4. **Data inventory** — sensitive data categories handled (PHI, PII, payment card data, student records, trade secrets)
5. **Approving authority** — CEO, Board, CISO, General Counsel signature blocks needed

## Output Structure

### Document Control Block

### Section Outline

**1. Purpose & Authority**
- Business rationale (financial, reputational, regulatory risk)
- Authorizing resolution; relationship to other org policies

**2. Scope**
- **Entities:** parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, JVs
- **Personnel:** employees, contractors, vendors, partners
- **Assets:** electronic data, physical records, IP, BYOD, remote environments
- **Exclusions:** publicly available info, de-identified data (define standard)

**3. Definitions**
Define with legal precision; flag where definitions vary by jurisdiction:
- Confidential Information, Personal Data / PII (per GDPR Art. 4, CCPA § 1798.140, HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 160.103)

| Confidential | Limited distribution; legal obligations | Customer PII, financial data |
| Restricted | Highest sensitivity; regulatory protection | PHI, payment card data, credentials |

**5. Access Controls**
- Least privilege; separation of duties
- Lifecycle: request → data owner approval → provisioning → quarterly review → revocation on role change/termination

**6. Authentication**

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|---------|
| Password length | 12+ characters; mixed case, numbers, symbols |
| MFA required for | Remote access, privileged accounts, Restricted data, cloud admin |
| Acceptable MFA | TOTP, hardware token, biometric; SMS discouraged for high-risk |
| Shared credentials | Prohibited |

**7. Encryption Standards**

| Context | Minimum Standard |
|---------|-----------------|
| Data at rest (Confidential/Restricted) | AES-256 |
| Data in transit | TLS 1.2+ (1.3 preferred) |
| Portable devices | Full-disk encryption |
| Email (Restricted) | End-to-end or secure portal |
| Backup media | Encrypted; separate key management |

Review annually; superseded by org Security Standards if more stringent.

**8. Acceptable Use**
- Prohibited: illegal activity, harassment, circumventing controls, credential sharing
- Monitoring: org reserves right; no expectation of privacy on org systems
- BYOD: MDM enrollment, encryption, remote wipe on loss/termination

**9. Physical Security**
- Lock unattended devices; clean desk for Confidential/Restricted materials
- Secure disposal: cross-cut shredding (paper); cryptographic erasure or destruction (media)
- Visitor access: escorted in secure areas; logs maintained

**10. Data Retention & Disposal**

| Category | Period | Basis |
|----------|--------|-------|
| PHI | 6 years | HIPAA 45 C.F.R. § 164.530(j) |
| Financial records | 7 years | IRS / GLBA |
| Student records | Per FERPA | 34 C.F.R. § 99 |
| Incident logs | 3 years min | [Regulatory basis] |

Certificate of destruction required for Restricted data.

**11. Roles & Responsibilities**

| Role | Obligations |
|------|-------------|
| Board / Exec | Policy approval; resource allocation |
| CISO | Program ownership; standards; audit; regulator liaison |
| IT / Security | Controls; patching; monitoring; vulnerability mgmt |
| Legal / Privacy | Breach notification decisions; regulatory liaison |
| Managers | Access approval; team compliance; off-boarding |
| All Employees | Credential protection; incident reporting; training |
| DPO | Required under GDPR Art. 37 if applicable |

**12. Incident Response**

Lifecycle:
1. **Detect & Report** — within [1–4 hours] to security hotline
2. **Assess** — severity triage; activate IRT if Sev 1/2
3. **Contain** — isolate systems; preserve evidence; chain of custody
4. **Eradicate** — remove threat; patch vulnerability
5. **Recover** — restore from clean backups; verify integrity
6. **Post-Incident Review** — within 14 days; root cause; corrective action plan

IRT: CISO (lead), IT Security, Legal, HR, PR/Comms, Executive Sponsor.

**13. Breach Notification**

| Framework | Deadline | Recipients |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| HIPAA | 60 days (individuals); 60 days HHS + media if 500+ | Individuals, HHS, media |
| GDPR | 72 hours to SA; without undue delay to individuals if high risk | SA, affected individuals |
| CCPA/CPRA | Expedient / without unreasonable delay | Consumers; AG if 500+ CA |
| State laws | 30–90 days (varies) | Residents, AGs, credit bureaus |

## Guidelines

- **Multi-jurisdiction conflicts:** apply most stringent standard or add jurisdiction-specific schedules
- **Encryption floors:** AES-256 / TLS 1.2+ are minimums; revise per NIST guidance updates
- **GDPR DPO:** required if org is public authority, conducts large-scale monitoring, or processes special category data at scale — confirm applicability before drafting `[VERIFY]`
- **HIPAA BAAs:** policy cross-references but does not replace BAA; maintain separate vendor register
- **PCI DSS:** detailed technical controls in separate PCI documentation to allow updates without policy re-approval
- **At-will disclaimer:** verify enforceability under applicable state law `[VERIFY]`
- **Collective bargaining:** if unionized workforce, confirm no bargaining obligation before implementation
- **Do not fabricate citations** — use `[VERIFY]` for any citation not confirmed against primary source
