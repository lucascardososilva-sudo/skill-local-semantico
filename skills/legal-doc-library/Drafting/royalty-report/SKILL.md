# Royalty Report Form

Drafts a certification-ready royalty report satisfying licensee reporting obligations under an IP license agreement. Functions as both an accounting instrument and a legally binding compliance document.

## Quick Start

1. Obtain the governing license agreement (including amendments)
2. Extract key terms into the extraction checklist below
3. Collect sales data for the reporting period (or confirm template-only output)
4. Draft report following the output structure
5. If prior reports exist, carry forward advance recoupment balances and cumulative tier thresholds

If multiple license agreements exist in uploaded documents, ask which governs before proceeding.

> If the agreement prescribes specific certification language, incorporate it **verbatim**.

```

### 5. Payment Instructions

## Critical Checks

- **Entity names** — must exactly match signature block names; any variance may invalidate submission
- **Deductions** — include only those explicitly authorized; when uncertain, flag: `[VERIFY DEDUCTION ELIGIBILITY UNDER SECTION [X]]`
- **Audit exposure** — every figure must reconcile to source documents; reports typically auditable 2-3 years
- **Missing info** — use bracketed placeholders referencing the specific section: `[INSERT ROYALTY RATE FROM SECTION 4.2]`
- **Tiered calculations** — if cumulative annual thresholds apply, account for sales in prior periods of the same contract year
- **Supporting documents** — check whether agreement requires attachments (invoices, territory breakdowns, accountant certifications)
- **Misrepresentation risk** — report creates binding contractual representations; emphasize accuracy over speed

**Key changes made:**

- **Frontmatter**: Removed `tags` (not in spec), tightened description to be third-person with clear trigger guidance
- **Structure**: Replaced "Prerequisites" with a "Quick Start" workflow, renamed "Key Extraction from License Agreement" to shorter "Key Extraction Checklist", consolidated "Formatting Requirements" and "Guidelines" into a single "Critical Checks" section
- **Extraction table**: Merged licensor/licensee name rows; merged royalty rate/tier rows — fewer rows, same info
- **Templates preserved**: Header, sales table, royalty calculation, and certification blocks kept intact as essential domain content
- **Trimmed**: Removed Email/Phone from signature block (non-essential), removed Reference No. from header, removed "Currency per agreement; right-align all numerical columns" (obvious formatting), removed checkbox-style certification list (replaced with bullet attestation list), cut "Formatting Requirements" section entirely (standard knowledge)
- **Line count**: ~159 → ~127 lines of content (well under the 500-line limit)
