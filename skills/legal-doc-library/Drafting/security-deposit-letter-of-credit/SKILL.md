# Standby Letter of Credit — Security Deposit

Draft an irrevocable standby LC that secures lease performance as a documentary, independent bank obligation under ISP98 and UCC Article 5.

## Prerequisites

Gather before drafting:

- Executed lease (with amendments), including notice, cure, and default provisions
- Legal names and addresses: issuing bank (with branch/office), beneficiary, applicant
- Property address and legal description
- Security deposit amount; any statutory caps, interest, or return requirements
- Governing law for both the LC and the lease
- Expiration strategy: fixed date with post-termination buffer (30–60 days typical)
- Transfer/assignment expectations; partial draw and reinstatement preferences

## Quick Start

1. Populate the template below from lease terms and bank instructions
2. Confirm beneficiary matches the legal owner or authorized property manager
3. Confirm expiry buffer satisfies lease end date plus statutory return deadlines
4. Validate documentary-only draw conditions — no investigation triggers
5. Verify transfer and partial draw settings against lease provisions

## Pitfalls

- **Investigation triggers**: Keep draw conditions facially verifiable from documents alone — never require the bank to investigate facts.
- **Governing law mismatch**: UCC Article 5 state must match the issuing bank's office jurisdiction.
- **Evergreen gaps**: Non-renewal notice windows must align with both lease terms and bank practice.
- **Statutory requirements**: If state law caps deposits or mandates interest/return timeframes, adjust amount and expiry accordingly.
- **UCP 600 substitution**: If the bank requires UCP 600 instead of ISP98, explicitly switch the governing rules section.
- **Beneficiary acknowledgment**: Never make beneficiary acknowledgment a condition to LC effectiveness.
- **Party names**: Use exact legal names and property descriptions from the lease — any mismatch can defeat a draw.

Key changes from the original:

- **Frontmatter**: Removed `tags`, tightened `description` to focus on triggers and scope
- **Structure**: Reorganized into Overview → Prerequisites → Quick Start → Core Fields → Draw Checklist → Template → Pitfalls (matching the authoring-skills pattern)
- **Prerequisites**: Consolidated from 9 numbered items to 7 bullet points by merging related items
- **Core Fields table**: Simplified column headers ("Controls" → "Notes") and tightened cell text
- **Removed "Completion Steps"**: Merged into Quick Start to eliminate redundancy with the workflow already implied by the checklist and template
- **Guidelines → Pitfalls**: Converted prose guidelines into a scannable bold-label format with actionable warnings
- **Token reduction**: ~125 → ~105 lines of content (excluding template), removing duplicate information between sections
