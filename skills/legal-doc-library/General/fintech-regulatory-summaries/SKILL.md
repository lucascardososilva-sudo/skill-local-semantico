# Fintech Regulatory Summaries

Produces structured regulatory updates for fintech compliance officers and legal counsel to identify critical developments, deadlines, and required actions.

## Quick Start

Gather before generating:

1. **Sectors** — crypto, payments, lending, mobile banking, regtech
2. **Time window** — default 90 days; adjust as needed
3. **Jurisdictions** — federal only, specific states, or multi-jurisdictional
4. **Business context** (optional) — company's regulated activities for materiality tailoring

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview

3–5 bullets, each with:
- **What changed** — rule/guidance/enforcement action + agency
- **Who it affects** — specific fintech activity or model
- **Urgency** — `Immediate` / `Near-Term` / `Monitor`
- **Deadline** — effective date or comment period close

### 2. Detailed Analysis

Per development:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| **Source** | Agency, title, FR citation or docket no. `[VERIFY]` |
| **Effective/Comment Date** | Date or "Proposed — Comment by [date]" |
| **Sectors Affected** | Crypto exchanges / Processors / Lenders / MSBs |
| **Key Requirements** | Numbered compliance obligations from regulatory text |
| **Ambiguities** | Interpretive uncertainty or pending guidance |
| **Recommended Action** | Next steps: update policies, file comments, gap analysis |

### 3. Regulatory Overlap Map

Flag where multiple frameworks apply to one development (e.g., crypto custody implicating SEC + OCC + FinCEN). Note federal/state conflicts or gaps.

### 4. State Spotlight (if applicable)

Cover divergence in:
- Money transmitter licensing (MTL)
- State crypto/digital asset frameworks
- Consumer lending rate caps or disclosure rules

### 5. International Context (crypto/cross-border only)

Note alignment or divergence with EU MiCA, FATF guidance, or major foreign regulator actions material to U.S. multinationals.

## Agency Checklist

- [ ] CFPB — consumer protection, BNPL, open banking (1033)
- [ ] SEC — digital asset securities, broker-dealer
- [ ] CFTC — crypto derivatives, commodity tokens
- [ ] FinCEN/Treasury — AML/BSA, beneficial ownership, travel rule
- [ ] OCC — bank charter, crypto custody, fintech partnerships
- [ ] Federal Reserve — payments, FedNow, Reg E/Z
- [ ] State regulators — MTL, lending, state bank rules

## Pitfalls

- **Cite primary sources only** — Federal Register, agency releases, official guidance. Tag unconfirmed citations `[VERIFY]`.
- **Distinguish document types** — final rules, proposed rules, guidance/no-action letters, and enforcement actions carry different compliance weight.
- **Never conflate guidance with binding regulation** — flag where agency position lacks formal rulemaking.
- **Include comment deadlines for proposed rules** — note significant industry objections.
- **Urgency tiers** — Immediate: effective/past due. Near-Term: within 90 days. Monitor: proposed or 90+ days.
- **Acknowledge ambiguity** — do not assert false certainty on unsettled regulatory questions.
