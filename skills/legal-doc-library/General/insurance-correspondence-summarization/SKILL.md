# Insurance Correspondence Summarization

Synthesizes insurance claims correspondence into a structured briefing with actionable coverage and litigation intelligence. Jurisdiction: US.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claim correspondence** — coverage letters, ROR letters, denial letters, demand letters, claim notices, insurer responses
2. **Policy documents** — if available; flag if missing
3. **Underlying litigation materials** — if referenced (pleadings, case caption, court/docket)

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview (2–3 paragraphs)

- Claim type, status, key parties (insured, insurer, claimant, counsel)
- Urgent coverage or liability issues needing immediate attention

### 2. Factual Background

- Underlying incident: date, location, parties, nature of alleged injury/damage/loss
- Distinguish **undisputed facts** from **contested allegations**

### 3. Coverage Analysis

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Policy number(s) | |
| Coverage type(s) | |
| Policy period | |
| Limits / deductibles | |
| Insurer's position | Grant / ROR / Denial |
| Policy language cited | Quote with attribution |
| Disputes / ambiguities | |

### 4. Claims Chronology

| Date | Document | Sender → Recipient | Key Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

Include: initial notice, coverage positions, ROR letters, demands, responses, ADR/coverage litigation filings.

### 5. Settlement Posture

- All demands and offers (with dollar amounts)
- Conditions attached to proposals
- Status: ongoing / stalled / concluded

### 6. Missing Documents

List documents referenced but not provided that are needed for complete analysis.

### 7. Next Steps / Action Items

Flag: coverage response deadlines, investigation gaps, declaratory relief considerations, settlement authority needed.

## Guidelines

- **Synthesize across documents** — consolidate related information into single sections; do not summarize document-by-document
- **Quote policy language** verbatim when cited as coverage basis; include document name and date
- **Separate coverage from underlying litigation** — summarize underlying case only as it affects coverage analysis

## Critical Flags

Watch for and explicitly flag:

- **Bad faith indicators**: unreasonable delay, inadequate investigation, wrongful denial, failure to defend
- **Insured conduct issues**: cooperation clause concerns, late notice, misrepresentation
- **Procedural traps**: statute of limitations, notice requirements, conditions precedent

**Key changes from the original:**

- **Removed `tags`** — not part of the Agent Skills spec (only `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` are valid frontmatter fields)
- **Tightened description** — removed redundant enumeration of audience roles; kept trigger keywords and concise functional summary
- **Added jurisdiction inline** to overview instead of burying it as a trailing bullet
- **Compressed verbose sections** — "Missing Documents" and "Next Steps" reduced to single directive lines instead of prose paragraphs
- **Split "Guidelines" into two focused sections** — core synthesis guidelines vs. critical flags to watch for, improving scannability
- **Removed redundant wording** throughout (e.g., "List any documents referenced but not provided that are needed for complete analysis" → "List documents referenced but not provided that are needed for complete analysis")
- **Line count reduced** from 69 to 65 lines while preserving all domain-specific content
