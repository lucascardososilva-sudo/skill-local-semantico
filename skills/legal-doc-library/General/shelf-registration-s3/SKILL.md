# Shelf Registration Statement (Form S-3)

Drafts a Form S-3 shelf registration enabling eligible public companies to register securities for delayed or continuous offerings over a three-year period.

## Prerequisites

1. **Corporate documents** — charter, bylaws, board resolutions authorizing filing
2. **Recent SEC filings** — latest 10-K, subsequent 10-Qs, 8-Ks, prior registration statements
3. **Capital structure** — outstanding shares by class, debt instruments, credit agreements, warrant/option schedules
4. **Public float calculation** — aggregate market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates (within 60 days of filing)
5. **SEC identifiers** — CIK code, file number, reporting history
6. **Offering parameters** — security types, maximum aggregate offering amount, capital raising objectives

## Eligibility Verification

Confirm one pathway before drafting:

| Pathway | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **I.B.1 — Public Float** | US/Canadian org + Section 12(b)/12(g) registered + 12 months reporting + reports current + public float ≥ $75M |
| **I.B.2 — Investment Grade** | Same reporting requirements + non-convertible securities rated investment grade |
| **WKSI** | All I.B.1 + either (a) worldwide public float ≥ $700M or (b) ≥ $1B non-convertible securities issued in registered offerings in prior 3 years |

WKSI: automatic effectiveness upon filing under Rule 462(e).

### 3. Risk Factors (Item 503(c) Reg S-K)

- **Guidelines → Checks**: Renamed to match codebase convention; added `[VERIFY]` markers for attorney-review checkpoints
- **Overall**: Reduced from 175 lines to ~135 lines while preserving all legally substantive content, eligibility thresholds, regulatory citations, and checklist items
