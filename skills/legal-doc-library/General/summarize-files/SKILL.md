# Summarize Legal Documents

Produce standalone, structured summaries of one or more legal documents for professional reference.

## Quick Start

1. Receive one or more legal files (contracts, pleadings, correspondence, transactional docs).
2. Read all uploaded content exhaustively — never sample or skip sections.
3. Classify each document, extract key data, and output the summary using the template below.

## Workflow

### 1. Classify Document Type

| Type | Analysis Focus |
|---|---|
| Contract / Agreement | Parties, obligations, terms, defined terms, reps & warranties, conditions precedent, dispute provisions |
| Pleading | Causes of action, factual allegations, relief requested, procedural posture, legal authority |
| Correspondence | Negotiation positions, admissions, strategic signals, communication timeline |
| Transactional | Deal structure, consideration, reps & warranties, closing conditions, indemnification |

### 2. Extract Key Data

From every document, capture:
- Parties (full legal names, roles)
- Key dates and deadlines
- Monetary amounts and consideration
- Claims, defenses, or obligations
- Legal authority cited
- Exhibits, attachments, referenced materials
- Defined terms (use consistently throughout)
- Ambiguities or internal conflicts

### 3. Output Summary

```
# Summary: [Document Title / Subject Matter]
Date of Summary: [date]

## Overview
[Type, parties, fundamental purpose — 2-3 sentences]

## Key Parties
[Table or list: name, role, relationship]

## Substantive Summary
[Organized by logical sections mirroring the source structure]

## Key Terms and Conditions
[Dates, deadlines, amounts, obligations — use tables where appropriate]

## Notable Issues
[Ambiguities, conflicts, missing information, concerns]

## Source Attribution
[For multi-file summaries: which document each key fact derives from]
```

## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Completeness over brevity** — never omit material information; flag conflicts rather than resolving by assumption.
- **Source attribution** — cite which document each significant fact comes from, especially across multiple files.
- **Preserve precision** — retain qualifications, limitations, and conditions; use defined terms as defined in the source.
- **Proportional length** — target 70-90% reduction while retaining all material information.
- **No legal conclusions** — summarize positions as presented; do not evaluate merits or predict outcomes.
- **Readability** — bold party names and key terms; use tables for claims, obligations, or chronological events.
