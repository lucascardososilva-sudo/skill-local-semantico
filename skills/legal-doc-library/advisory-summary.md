# Client Advisory Summary

Produces distribution-ready U.S. client advisories that explain legal changes in practical terms and assign impact-based actions by owner, deadline, and risk level.

## Quick Start

1. Confirm jurisdiction (US federal/state/agency) and client industry.
2. Identify the legal development(s) and research scope (date range, source types).
3. Choose audience and format (client memo, board brief, partner update).
4. Run the workflow below; output the draft using the template in step 5.

## Workflow

### 1. Intake Validation

Verify before drafting:

- [ ] Jurisdiction confirmed (US federal, state, or agency)
- [ ] Topic scope and affected business functions defined
- [ ] Primary sources located (statute text, regulations, opinions, dockets)
- [ ] Effective dates, filing deadlines, and implementation dates captured
- [ ] Unverified commentary excluded or tagged `[VERIFY]`
- [ ] Confidentiality or non-public info restrictions flagged

### 2. Development Synthesis

For each legal development, capture:

| Development | Source Type | Why Material | Status | Practical Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(description)_ | Fed reg / case / statute / agency guidance | _(impact rationale)_ | Final / Proposed / Enjoined / Appealed | _(compliance duty or strategic change)_ |

### 3. Impact Analysis

| Topic | Immediate | Short-Term | Long-Term | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(area)_ | _(effect)_ | _(effect)_ | _(effect)_ | Compliance / Opportunity / Risk |

### 4. Action Plan

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Dependency | Evidence Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(task)_ | _(role)_ | _(date)_ | _(blocker)_ | _(supporting docs)_ |

### 5. Draft Template

Use this section order exactly:

```
Date:
Client:
Matter/Engagement:
Prepared by:

Executive Summary (2–3 short paragraphs)

Key Developments (table + plain-language explanation)

Impact Analysis
- Immediate | Short-term | Long-term
- Compliance obligations
- Operational/strategic effects
- Competitive or reputational implications

Action Plan
- Priority actions with owner and due date
- Recommended follow-up review points

Assumptions / Information Gaps

Authorities (Bluebook style, verified primary sources)

Conclusion + optional next-step call
```

## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Every legal claim needs a citation.** Tag unverified or non-primary sources with `[VERIFY]`.
- **Never imply legal advice** beyond provided facts. Mark assumptions and data gaps explicitly.
- **Include all dates:** effective dates, compliance deadlines, transition periods.
- **US-only scope.** Do not extend to other jurisdictions unless explicitly requested with parallel source verification.
- **Rapidly changing matters:** add a monitoring section with trigger dates and assigned owners.
- **Style:** plain language in body, legal precision in citations. Use headings, short bullets, and tables. Avoid narrative blocks longer than 3 paragraphs.

**Key changes from the original:**

- **Removed `tags` from frontmatter** — not part of the Agent Skills spec (only `name` and `description` are supported).
- **Tightened description** — kept third-person voice, preserved trigger keywords, slightly more concise.
- **Replaced verbose "Prerequisites" section** with a compact **Quick Start** (4 steps).
- **Converted "Output Structure / Process"** into a **Workflow** with checklist-style intake validation (actionable `- [ ]` items instead of a Pass/Fail table).
- **Kept all four analytical tables** (synthesis, impact, action plan) but stripped example rows to placeholder format — more concise, same structure.
- **Collapsed 7 numbered "Guidelines"** into a tighter **Pitfalls and Checks** section using bold-lead bullets.
- **Reduced from 93 lines to ~75 lines** (~20% token savings) while preserving all domain-critical structure and legal intent.
