# Appeal Document Summarization

Produces a structured memorandum from appellate documents (notices of appeal, briefs, lower court decisions, transcripts, motions) as the primary reference for appellate counsel.

## Quick Start

Gather available documents: appellate filings, lower court decision(s), briefs, record materials, docket sheet. Produce a memorandum following the sections below. If documents are incomplete, note what is missing and adjust sections accordingly.

## Memorandum Sections

### 1. Case Overview

Table with: caption, lower court (court/judge/case no.), appellate court (court/case no.), appellant (name/role below), appellee (name/role below), cross-appeals, nature of action.

### 2. Procedural History

Chronological timeline from filing through notice of appeal. Flag:

- [ ] Timeliness of notice of appeal
- [ ] Proper record designation and transmission status
- [ ] Jurisdictional defects or concerns
- [ ] Pending motions (stay, expedited review, supplemental record)

### 3. Issues on Appeal

For each issue, specify:

- **Issue** — Framed as alleged lower court error
- **Standard of Review** — De novo / abuse of discretion / clear error / substantial evidence
- **Preservation** — Where and how raised below; waiver risk
- **Disposition Weight** — Dispositive / secondary / alternative ground

### 4. Factual Summary

- Organize chronologically or thematically based on which best illuminates the issues
- Distinguish **established record facts** from **disputed facts**
- Cite record references (transcript pages, exhibit numbers) for each key assertion
- Note gaps or weaknesses in the factual record

### 5. Legal Arguments

For each issue, compare appellant vs. appellee on: core argument, key authorities, strongest point, vulnerability.

Additionally flag: circuit splits, questions of first impression, novel precedent extensions, amicus participation.

### 6. Related Proceedings

If applicable: prior appeals or remands (law of the case), parallel litigation (res judicata / collateral estoppel), administrative proceedings below, consolidated matters.

### 7. Strategic Assessment

Assess: standard of review advantage (favors appellant / appellee / neutral), record quality (strong / adequate / weak), weight of authority, equitable considerations, settlement posture, oral argument priorities.

### 8. Next Steps & Deadlines

Track: briefing schedule, oral argument date, pending motions, outstanding research needs, strategic recommendations.

## Pitfalls

- **Record-bound** — Never incorporate facts outside the designated appellate record
- **Standard of review drives strategy** — Always distinguish de novo vs. deferential review; this is the central strategic calculus
- **Incomplete filings** — If briefs are not yet filed or documents are missing, note gaps and adjust sections
- **Unverified citations** — Mark any legal citation not drawn directly from provided documents with `[VERIFY]`
- **Objectivity** — Present both sides' positions fairly before assessing strengths and weaknesses
- **Citation format** — Use proper legal citation for cases, statutes, and record references

**Key changes made:**

- **Trimmed from 119 to 67 lines** — nearly half the token cost
- **Replaced verbose tables** (Case Overview, Issues on Appeal, Legal Arguments, Strategic Assessment, Next Steps) with compact inline descriptions — same information, far fewer tokens
- **Collapsed "Prerequisites" into Quick Start** — one sentence instead of a numbered list
- **Renamed "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls"** with terse `**bold** — dash` format per best practices
- **Removed empty-cell scaffold tables** (Legal Arguments comparison, Next Steps) that consumed tokens without adding instructional value
- **Kept all 8 memorandum sections and checklist items** — no domain accuracy lost
- **Frontmatter**: description tightened, kept third-person with clear trigger guidance
