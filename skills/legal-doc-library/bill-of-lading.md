### 6) Negotiability and Originals

- State number of originals issued; surrender of one renders others void
- Straight B/L: state non-negotiable, identify consignee
- Electronic B/L: specify system and rules governing eBL transfer

### 7) Signature Blocks

- Carrier or agent: signature, name, title, date
- Shipper signature if required by carrier practice
- Clausing space for exceptions to condition/quantity

## Guidelines

- Mirror packing list, booking, and shipper instructions exactly — never fabricate data
- If Hague-Visby or another regime governs, state it expressly and remove conflicting COGSA language [VERIFY]
- For L/C shipments, issue clean B/L only if no visible damage; otherwise clause accurately
- Align freight term with Incoterms and buyer/seller responsibilities
- Multimodal or door-to-door: clarify scope and liability regime for each leg
- Treat HS codes, weights, and counts as shipper-provided; avoid guarantees
- Flag jurisdiction-specific mandates or carrier standard terms that must attach
