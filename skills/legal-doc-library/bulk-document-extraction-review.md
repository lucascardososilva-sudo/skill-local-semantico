# Bulk Document Extraction & Review

Extracts structured data from sets of legal documents into tabular format. Each document becomes a row; user-defined questions become columns. Produces reviewable tables with source citations, then supports analysis across the extracted dataset.

## Prerequisites

1. **Document set** — the files to analyze (contracts, agreements, correspondence, filings, etc.)
2. **Extraction questions** — what to extract from each document (see Column Design below)
3. **Document type** — the nature of the documents (e.g., all NDAs, mixed data room, email set)
4. **Review purpose** — what the table will be used for (DD report, compliance check, portfolio analysis, case chronology)
5. **Output preferences** — format (table, CSV, report narrative), language, level of detail

If extraction questions are not provided, propose a standard column set based on the document type.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Column Design

Define extraction columns. Each column is a question asked of every document. Column types:

| Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Verbatim** | Extract exact language from the document | "What is the governing law clause?" |
| **Free response** | Summarize or interpret | "Summarize the key obligations of the Seller" |
| **Classification** | Yes/No or category | "Does this agreement contain a change-of-control provision?" |
| **Date** | Extract specific dates | "What is the effective date?" |
| **Numeric** | Extract amounts, percentages | "What is the liability cap amount?" |
| **List** | Multiple items from same document | "List all defined terms" |

**Standard column sets by document type:**

**Contracts / Agreements:**
- Document name and type
- Parties (with roles)
- Effective date and term
- Governing law and jurisdiction
- Key financial terms (price, payment, caps)
- Termination provisions (convenience, cause, notice period)
- Assignment / change of control
- Indemnification scope
- Limitation of liability
- Confidentiality term
- Unusual or non-standard provisions
- Red flags or concerns

**Correspondence / Emails:**
- Date and time
- Sender and recipient(s)
- Subject
- Key facts or events described
- Commitments or action items
- Attachments referenced
- Privilege indicators

**Court Filings / Pleadings:**
- Filing date
- Document type (motion, brief, order, etc.)
- Filing party
- Relief sought or ruling issued
- Key arguments or findings
- Deadlines or next dates
- Cited authorities

### Phase 2: Document Processing

For each document in the set:

1. **Identify** — document name, type, date, page count
2. **Extract** — answer each column question with:
   - The extracted value
   - Source citation (page number, section, paragraph)
   - Confidence indicator when the answer requires interpretation
3. **Flag** — note any documents that:
   - Cannot be processed (corrupted, illegible, wrong format)
   - Contain ambiguous answers for a given column
   - Have notable omissions (expected provision absent)

### Phase 3: Table Assembly

Compile results into a structured table:

| Doc # | Document Name | [Column 1] | [Column 2] | ... | [Column N] | Flags |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Table conventions:**
- One row per document
- Empty cells marked "Not found" or "N/A" (distinguish between absent and inapplicable)
- Multi-value cells use semicolons as delimiters
- Source citations in parentheses after each value: (§3.2, p.7)
- Flags column captures anomalies, concerns, or items requiring attorney review

### Phase 4: Cross-Document Analysis

After extraction, analyze the dataset:

#### 4a. Summary Statistics
- Total documents processed / skipped / flagged
- Distribution of key values (e.g., "65% have mutual indemnification, 35% one-sided")
- Date ranges (earliest and latest effective dates, expirations)
- Outliers (documents with unusual terms relative to the set)

#### 4b. Risk and Anomaly Report
- **Inconsistencies** — documents with conflicting terms (different governing law, conflicting definitions)
- **Missing provisions** — documents lacking standard clauses present in majority of set
- **Outlier terms** — values significantly different from the norm (unusually high caps, short cure periods)
- **Red flags** — provisions requiring immediate attorney attention

#### 4c. Comparative Analysis
- Side-by-side comparison of key terms across selected documents
- Deviation from standard or template language
- Trend analysis (if documents span time periods)

### Phase 5: Report Generation

Based on the extracted table and analysis, produce:

1. **Executive summary** — key findings, overall risk assessment, critical items requiring action
2. **Detailed table** — full extraction results (Phase 3 output)
3. **Analysis narrative** — written summary of cross-document patterns, risks, and recommendations
4. **Follow-up list** — documents or issues requiring further review, with specific questions

## Use Case Templates

### M&A Due Diligence Data Room
**Columns:** Parties, Date, Contract type, Term, Renewal, Change of control, Assignment consent, Material financial terms, Restrictive covenants, IP provisions, Termination triggers, Red flags
**Analysis focus:** Change-of-control provisions that could block closing, material contracts requiring consent, unusual termination rights, aggregate financial exposure

### Lease Portfolio Review
**Columns:** Property, Landlord, Tenant, Commencement, Expiration, Renewal options, Monthly rent, Escalation, CAM/NNN, Assignment/subletting, Termination rights, Restoration obligations
**Analysis focus:** Upcoming expirations, below/above-market rents, assignment restrictions affecting transactions, aggregate lease obligations

### Employment Agreement Audit
**Columns:** Employee, Title, Start date, Term, Base compensation, Bonus/equity, Non-compete scope and duration, Non-solicit, IP assignment, Severance triggers, Change-of-control provisions, Governing law
**Analysis focus:** Non-compete enforceability by jurisdiction, aggregate severance exposure, key person dependencies, inconsistencies across similar roles

### Regulatory Filing Review
**Columns:** Filing type, Filing date, Filer, Jurisdiction, Status, Key disclosures, Material changes from prior filing, Deficiencies noted, Response deadline
**Analysis focus:** Compliance gaps, missed deadlines, material disclosure changes, cross-filing consistency

## Guidelines

- Every extracted value must include a source citation (section, page, or paragraph reference)
- Distinguish between "Not found" (searched but absent) and "N/A" (not applicable to this document type)
- Do not infer or extrapolate values — extract only what the document explicitly states
- When a provision is ambiguous, extract the verbatim language and flag for attorney review rather than interpreting
- Process documents in consistent order (alphabetical, chronological, or as provided)
- For large sets, process in batches and maintain consistent column definitions across batches
- Flag any document that appears to be a duplicate or superseded version
- Note document language — if documents are in multiple languages, indicate the source language and whether extraction was from the original or a translation
- Mark [VERIFY] on any extracted value where confidence is low due to poor document quality, ambiguous language, or complex cross-references
- Maintain a processing log: document name, status (processed/skipped/flagged), notes
