# Class Notice Communication Plan

Produces a court-ready plan for disseminating class notice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) and due process requirements.

## Prerequisites

Collect before drafting:

- Class certification order or proposed certification motion
- Class definition and any subclasses (verbatim from order)
- Claims, defenses, and relief sought
- Court-ordered deadlines (opt-out, objection, fairness hearing, trial)
- Available class member data sources and quality assessment
- Settlement terms affecting notice (if applicable)
- Proposed claims administrator or notice expert (if any)

## Quick Start

Generate each section below in order. Populate tables from user-supplied inputs. Mark unknowns with `[TBD]`.

## Core Sections

### 1. Case Header

Table with: case name, court/case number, judge, procedural posture, certification order date, governing rules (default: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B); due process), key deadlines.

### 2. Legal Standards

| Authority | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) | Best notice practicable; individual notice where feasible |
| Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank | Notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties |
| Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin | Individual notice to identifiable class members |
| CAFA 28 U.S.C. § 1715 | Government notice for covered settlements (if applicable) |

### 3. Class Definition and Identification

Table with: class definition (verbatim), subclasses (verbatim), estimated class size, geographic/temporal limits, data sources, data gaps and remediation plan.

### 4. Required Notice Content

Every notice must include per Rule 23(c)(2)(B):

- [ ] Nature of the action
- [ ] Definition of the class
- [ ] Class claims, issues, and defenses
- [ ] Right to enter an appearance through counsel
- [ ] Right to request exclusion and method for doing so
- [ ] Time and manner for requesting exclusion
- [ ] Binding effect of a class judgment on class members

### 5. Notice Form Specifications

- **Tone**: Neutral, non-advocacy
- **Readability**: Plain language; target ~8th grade for consumer classes
- **Languages**: Translations where material class segments are non-English
- **Accessibility**: ADA-compliant; mobile-responsive web

### 6. Delivery Methods

| Channel | When Used | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Direct mail | Identifiable addresses | First-class; NCOA updates; re-mail undeliverables |
| Email | Reliable email addresses | SPF/DKIM compliance; bounce tracking |
| Publication | Non-identifiable members | Targeted print/digital; market-specific |
| Digital ads | Broad or niche reach | Geo/demo targeting aligned with class |
| Settlement website | All cases | Notice, claim form, FAQs, key dates |
| Toll-free line | All cases | Live + automated; multilingual if needed |

### 7. Data Hygiene

- [ ] Run NCOA updates before initial mailing
- [ ] Track returns; skip-trace undeliverables
- [ ] Re-mail within defined window after address correction
- [ ] Maintain audit trail of all address updates

### 8. Timeline

Milestones: court approval of plan → data extraction → website/hotline live → mail/email launch → publication run → opt-out deadline → objection deadline → fairness hearing/trial → due diligence declaration filed.

Default timing guidance (when not court-ordered):
- Direct notice: 60-90 days before opt-out deadline
- Publication: 2-4 weeks aligned with direct notice
- Re-mailing: 14-21 days after return processing

### 9. Budget

Categories: claims administrator fees, data processing, printing/mail, publication, website/hosting, hotline, translation, contingency (10-20% reserve). Include basis and estimate for each.

### 10. Court Approval Package

- [ ] Proposed notice plan
- [ ] Proposed notice forms
- [ ] Declaration from notice expert or claims administrator
- [ ] Compliance statement for Rule 23 and due process
- [ ] CAFA notice plan (if applicable)

### 11. Monitoring and Reporting

| Metric | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Mail sent/returned/re-mailed | Mail logs | Due diligence declaration |
| Email delivered/bounced | ESP reports | Effectiveness metrics |
| Publication insertions | Media affidavits | Compliance proof |
| Website traffic | Analytics | Reach assessment |
| Hotline volume | Call logs | Issue tracking |
| Opt-outs/objections | Administrator tracking | Court reporting |

### 12. Exhibits

List: (A) long-form notice, (B) postcard/short-form notice, (C) publication notice, (D) media plan and rate cards, (E) due diligence declaration template.

## Pitfalls and Checks

- Never disseminate notice before court approval
- Use verbatim class definitions from the certification order
- Align all deadlines with court orders; never invent dates
- CAFA notice is mandatory for covered settlements
- Avoid legalese; clarity and neutrality are required
- Flag jurisdiction-specific deviations if not in federal court
- Add `[VERIFY]` to any uncertain citation or rule

Key changes from the original:

- **Removed `tags`** — not part of the Agent Skills spec (only `name` and `description` are valid frontmatter fields)
- **Tightened description** — added explicit trigger guidance ("Trigger when user mentions...")
- **Collapsed empty template tables** — Sections 1, 3, and 9 now use inline prose descriptions instead of large empty-value tables that Claude can generate on its own
- **Converted checklists to task format** — Used `- [ ]` for actionable items (sections 4, 7, 10) to match workflow checklist patterns
- **Condensed timeline** — Replaced the empty milestone table with a compact arrow-chain flow plus timing defaults
- **Reduced from ~170 lines to ~120 lines** — removed token cost of empty table scaffolding while preserving all domain-critical content (legal standards, Rule 23 requirements, delivery methods, monitoring metrics)
- **Added Quick Start** section per best practices
