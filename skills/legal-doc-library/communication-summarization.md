# Communication Summarization

Distills legal communication chains into a structured memorandum capturing decisions, commitments, deadlines, and legally significant elements.

## Quick Start

1. Collect source communications (email threads, meeting notes, transcripts)
2. Gather matter context if available (contracts, prior agreements, party relationships)
3. Produce memorandum following the output structure below

## Output Structure

### Header Block

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| To | [Requesting attorney / matter file] |
| From | CaseMark |
| Date | [Today's date] |
| Re | Communication Summary — [Matter/Subject] |
| Sources | [All documents/threads reviewed] |

### 1. Executive Overview

2–3 sentences: purpose of communications, period covered, key outcome or current status.

### 2. Background and Context

- Parties involved (names, roles, organizations)
- Communication period (date range)
- Subject matter / transaction / dispute

### 3. Key Decisions and Agreements

| Date | Parties | Decision / Agreement | Source |
|---|---|---|---|

Flag agreements that modify existing contracts, could constitute acceptance/waiver/novation, or contain representations/admissions.

### 4. Commitments and Deadlines

| Date | Party | Commitment / Obligation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|

### 5. Outstanding Issues

- Unresolved disputes or open questions
- Conflicting party positions
- Gaps in the communication record

### 6. Legally Significant Language

Flag and quote verbatim (with source and date) any:
- Notice language (contractual or statutory)
- Admissions or representations
- Document/information requests
- References to contracts, statutes, or legal authorities
- Language that could toll deadlines or trigger obligations

### 7. Action Items

| Priority | Action | Responsible Party | Due Date | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Attribution required** — every factual claim must cite source document, sender, and date; never synthesize without attribution
- **Neutral tone** — report what parties said; do not characterize beyond what the source explicitly states
- **Superseding communications** — when later messages modify or override earlier ones, explicitly note the relationship
- **Multi-party matters** — organize by party or topic when three or more distinct parties are involved
- **Gaps** — flag missing correspondence or ambiguities; may indicate spoliation issues or areas needing clarification
- **Jurisdiction** — US default; flag references to non-US law or cross-border obligations for separate review

Key changes:
- **Description** rewritten in third-person with explicit trigger guidance ("Triggers when...")
- **Prerequisites** replaced with a streamlined **Quick Start** section
- **Output Structure** preserved but trimmed — removed empty table rows, collapsed checkbox list into a concise bullet list, tightened prose throughout
- **Guidelines** renamed to **Pitfalls and Checks** to match best-practice section naming
- Removed redundant explanation (e.g. the "Produce a memorandum-style document using the following sections" preamble) while keeping all domain-critical content intact
