# Legal Conference Summary

Generates distribution-ready conference summaries that preserve authority, nuance, and actionable guidance for corporate practice teams.

## Prerequisites

Gather before starting:

1. **Event basics** — name, dates, location/format, sponsor(s), theme
2. **Agenda** — session titles, tracks, times, formats
3. **Speaker roster** — names, roles, affiliations, credentials
4. **Session inputs** — notes, slides, handouts, recordings, Q&A logs
5. **Materials** — white papers, practice guides, model forms, studies
6. **Confidentiality scope** — what to anonymize or omit

## Quick Start

1. Collect all prerequisites above
2. Build the Event Snapshot table
3. Process each session into the Session Digest
4. Compile the Authorities Index with `[VERIFY]` flags
5. Extract actionable guidance, trends, and follow-ups
6. Review against the Checks below

## Output Structure

### Action Items

- Recommended internal trainings or policy updates
- Future events announced

## Checks

- Use `[VERIFY]` for any citation, quote, or statistic not confirmed in sources
- Preserve speaker credentials and affiliations exactly as stated
- Anonymize sensitive or client-specific references from informal sessions
- State jurisdiction scope explicitly when unclear or mixed
- Report what speakers said — do not include legal advice or editorialize
- Keep attribution precise; do not add substance beyond source materials

**Key changes made:**

- **Frontmatter**: Removed `tags` (not part of the spec), tightened `description` to be more concise while keeping trigger guidance
- **Added Quick Start**: Numbered workflow giving the agent a clear execution path
- **Flattened structure**: Promoted bold-label sections to proper `###` headings under a single `## Output Structure` parent — cleaner hierarchy, easier scanning
- **Trimmed redundancy**: Removed the "Cited By (Session #)" → "Session #" in Authorities Index, collapsed "Consensus vs. Divergence" from separate bullet groups into labeled inline entries, shortened table column headers
- **Renamed Guidelines → Checks**: Matches the skill authoring convention for pitfall/validation sections
- **Removed "Output Structure / Process"** dual label — single clear heading
- **Line count**: Reduced from 107 to ~95 lines while preserving all domain content and table templates
