# Consumer Loan Agreement

Produces an execution-ready consumer loan agreement with a Reg Z–compliant federal disclosure box and full contractual provisions for fixed-rate consumer credit.

## Quick Start

Collect before drafting:

1. **Lender** — legal name (including DBA), address, contact info
2. **Borrower(s)** — full legal name(s), addresses; co-borrower/guarantor if any
3. **Loan economics** — principal, interest rate, term, payment frequency, first payment date
4. **Fee schedule** — all charges imposed as condition of credit (origination, points, doc prep, service charges)
5. **Collateral** — description with identifiers (VIN/serial/legal description) if secured; confirm if unsecured
6. **Governing state** — for usury caps, prepayment penalty rules, cure periods, deficiency judgment limits
7. **Co-signer/guarantor** — triggers FTC co-signer notice (16 CFR Part 444)

## Output Structure

### 1. Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure Box

Place first on page one. Visually segregated (border/shading), heading bold ≥12pt, body ≥10pt. Use Reg Z–prescribed labels verbatim — never paraphrase.

| Reg Z Label | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Annual Percentage Rate** — The cost of your credit as a yearly rate | ≥2 decimal places; actuarial or U.S. Rule method; tolerance ±⅛% regular, ±¼% irregular (12 CFR § 1026.22) |
| **Finance Charge** — The dollar amount the credit will cost you | Total interest + all fees as condition of credit; itemize major components |
| **Amount Financed** — The amount of credit provided to you or on your behalf | Principal minus prepaid finance charges |
| **Total of Payments** — The amount you will have paid after making all scheduled payments | Amount Financed + Finance Charge |
| **Payment Schedule** — Your payment schedule will be | Uniform: count × amount × frequency. Irregular/balloon: full date-and-amount table |

**Math check**: Amount Financed + Finance Charge must equal Total of Payments. Recalculate APR if any fee or term changes.

### 2. Loan Terms and Conditions

**Loan purpose**: Include if required by state or for regulatory classification — "This loan is extended for personal, family, or household purposes."

**Prepayment**:
- No penalty: "You may prepay in whole or in part at any time without penalty beyond accrued interest to the prepayment date."
- Penalty applies: disclose conditions, period, calculation method, maximum amount conspicuously; verify state law permits

**Late charges**: Specify grace period (10–15 days), charge amount (e.g., 5% of payment or $25, lesser of), assessed once per late payment, not compounded. Confirm state cap compliance.

**Payment application order**: Late charges → accrued interest → principal → other fees

**If secured**:
- Grant security interest in described collateral
- Borrower covenants: maintain condition, keep lien-free, maintain insurance (lender as loss payee), no unauthorized transfer
- Lender may force-place insurance; cost added to balance

**If unsecured**: State no collateral pledged; remedies limited to those available for unsecured debt under applicable law.

### 3. Default, Acceleration, and Remedies

**Events of default**: missed payment, failure to maintain collateral insurance, bankruptcy/insolvency, material misrepresentation, impairment of collateral, borrower death (if loan does not survive).

**Acceleration**: Lender may declare entire balance due upon default, subject to state-required notice and cure period (specify days and delivery method).

**Collateral remedies** (secured only): Repossession (self-help where state permits), public or private sale with UCC-compliant notice, proceeds applied: repo/sale costs → interest → principal. Deficiency remains borrower obligation where state law permits.

### 4. Required Notices

| Trigger | Notice |
|---|---|
| Borrower is/may be servicemember | SCRA notice: 6% rate cap on pre-service obligations; borrower to notify lender upon activation |
| Co-signer not receiving proceeds | FTC Co-Signer Notice verbatim (16 CFR Part 444) |
| State law requires | Applicable verbatim notices (cure rights, pre-repossession, right of redemption) |

### 5. Execution Block

Borrower acknowledgment above signature lines: receipt of completed copy including TILA disclosures, agreement to all terms.

- Signature block per borrower/co-borrower: printed name, signature, date
- Separate guarantor block with FTC notice if applicable
- Lender block: authorized officer name, title, signature, date
- Provide executed copy to borrower at signing

## Pitfalls

- **TILA box placement**: Must precede all contract terms and be visually distinct — buried or merged disclosure is a Reg Z violation
- **Label integrity**: Use Reg Z–prescribed labels verbatim; paraphrasing violates disclosure requirements
- **APR consistency**: Verify APR, Finance Charge, Amount Financed, and Total of Payments are internally consistent before finalizing
- **State law layering**: Usury caps, prepayment penalty bans, cure periods, and deficiency restrictions vary by state — always confirm governing state rules
- **Scope limitation**: This skill covers fixed-rate transactions only. Variable-rate loans require additional ARM disclosures (12 CFR § 1026.19(b)). Mortgage/HELOC transactions require RESPA/TRID compliance — outside this skill's scope

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Resolution |
|---|---|
| APR exceeds tolerance | Recheck whether all fees imposed as condition of credit are included in Finance Charge; recalculate using actuarial method |
| Math check fails | Verify Amount Financed = principal minus prepaid finance charges; confirm Finance Charge includes total interest plus all qualifying fees |
| State rejects prepayment penalty | Many states prohibit penalties on consumer loans — remove penalty clause and re-draft prepayment as no-penalty |
| Missing co-signer notice | If any guarantor does not receive loan proceeds, FTC Co-Signer Notice is mandatory — add verbatim text from 16 CFR Part 444 |

It looks like the write permission hasn't been granted yet. Could you approve the file write so I can save the rewritten skill? Key changes made:

- **Description**: Tightened from 468 to 339 chars while preserving all trigger keywords and legal citations
- **Structure**: Reorganized to match template convention (Quick Start → Output Structure → Pitfalls → Troubleshooting)
- **Token reduction**: ~116 lines → ~93 lines of body content. Removed block quotes used as prose, eliminated redundant explanatory text, compressed default events and remedies into inline lists
- **Added Troubleshooting table**: Required by spec, was missing from original
- **Preserved**: All Reg Z labels verbatim, statutory citations, tolerance thresholds, SCRA/FTC notice requirements, scope limitations, math check requirement
