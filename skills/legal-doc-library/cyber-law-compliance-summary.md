# Cyber Law Compliance Summary

Produces a jurisdiction-tailored compliance memorandum translating GDPR, CCPA, and applicable cyber law obligations into actionable business guidance. Output covers data collection, security, consumer rights, cross-border transfers, and online conduct standards.

## Prerequisites

Gather before drafting:

1. **Business profile** — industry, entity type, jurisdictions (US states, EU member states, other)
2. **Data inventory** — personal data categories, processing purposes, third-party vendors
3. **Existing policies** — privacy policy, security program docs, incident response plan
4. **Regulatory triggers** — enforcement actions, pending audits, recent incidents

## Quick Start

1. Collect prerequisites above
2. Draft executive summary with risk priority matrix (High / Medium / Low)
3. Work through each compliance section using the per-section template
4. Build jurisdiction comparison table if multi-jurisdiction
5. Flag sensitive data categories with heightened obligations
6. Produce implementation checklist and emerging trends section

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Summary

- Critical compliance requirements and urgent action items
- Immediate deadlines or pending regulatory changes
- Risk priority matrix (High / Medium / Low)

### 2. Compliance Sections

Use this template for each section:

| Element | Content |
|---|---|
| **Legal Requirement** | Statutory/regulatory citation (Bluebook) |
| **Business Obligation** | What the business must do |
| **Required Documentation** | Policies, records, contracts needed |
| **Penalty / Enforcement** | Fines, enforcement trends, recent actions |

Sections to cover:

| # | Topic | Key Authorities |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Data Collection & Processing | GDPR Arts. 5–6, 13–14; CCPA §1798.100; state equivalents |
| 2 | Security & Breach Notification | GDPR Arts. 32–33; Cal. Civ. Code §1798.82; NIST CSF `[VERIFY]` |
| 3 | Consumer Rights & Transparency | GDPR Arts. 15–22; CCPA §§1798.110–.125; CAN-SPAM; COPPA |
| 4 | Cross-Border Data Transfers | GDPR Arts. 44–49; SCCs (2021); EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework |
| 5 | Online Conduct Standards | FTC Act §5; TCPA; state consumer protection statutes |

### 3. Jurisdiction Comparison Table

When multiple jurisdictions apply, produce side-by-side:

| Obligation | GDPR (EU) | CCPA/CPRA (CA) | [Other State] |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consent basis | Lawful basis required | Opt-out (sensitive: opt-in) | … |
| Breach notification | 72 hrs to DPA | 72 hrs if 500+ CA residents | … |
| Data subject rights | Access, erasure, portability | Access, deletion, opt-out of sale | … |

### 4. Sensitive Data Categories

| Category | Governing Law | Heightened Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Health / medical | HIPAA, GDPR Art. 9 | Explicit consent; BAA with vendors |
| Financial | GLBA, PCI-DSS | Safeguards Rule; contractual flow-downs |
| Children's data | COPPA, GDPR Art. 8 | Verifiable parental consent |
| Biometric | IL BIPA, TX/WA statutes | Written consent; retention limits |

### 5. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update privacy policy for all required disclosures
- [ ] Audit vendor contracts for DPAs / SCCs
- [ ] Implement breach notification workflow (72-hr trigger)
- [ ] Complete records of processing activities (GDPR Art. 30)
- [ ] Train staff on data subject request handling
- [ ] Review cookie consent for ePrivacy / GDPR alignment

### 6. Emerging Trends

- Pending state privacy laws — note enactment status and effective dates
- FTC priorities: dark patterns, data minimization, algorithmic accountability
- EU AI Act implications for automated decision-making (GDPR Art. 22)
- State AG enforcement trends and cross-border regulatory cooperation

## Pitfalls and Checks

- Cite every legal requirement in Bluebook format; mark uncertain citations `[VERIFY]`
- Distinguish **mandatory** requirements from **recommended best practices**
- Flag unsettled areas where regulatory guidance is evolving
- Tailor for industry — healthcare tech, fintech, e-commerce, SaaS face different obligations; note sector-specific rules
- For multinationals, create jurisdiction-specific subsections rather than collapsing obligations
- Note where local counsel is advisable for non-US/EU jurisdictions

**Key changes from the original:**

- **Description** trimmed from 390 to ~290 chars — removed redundant enumeration of sections already covered in the body
- **Added Quick Start** section for fast orientation on the workflow
- **Renamed "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls and Checks"** to match best-practice section naming
- **Renamed "Emerging Trends & Forward Look" to "Emerging Trends"** — shorter, no information lost
- **Tightened prerequisite labels** — e.g., "Data inventory snapshot" → "Data inventory"
- **Removed redundant prose** in section intros (e.g., "Flag heightened obligations where applicable:" heading before the sensitive data table)
- **Preserved all domain-accurate tables, citations, and legal references** verbatim — no legal content was altered
