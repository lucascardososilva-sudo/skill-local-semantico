# Cybersecurity Breach Summary

Legally defensible, source-attributed incident summary for executive, counsel, and regulator review.

## Quick Start

1. Gather incident reports, forensic analyses, system logs, and response documentation.
2. Confirm privilege boundaries and confidentiality flags from counsel.
3. Populate the template below with verified facts only — attribute each assertion to a source and date.
4. Separate known facts from hypotheses or open questions.

## Pitfalls

- **Speculation**: Label unknowns explicitly. Do not opine on liability — describe exposure factors only.
- **Timezone drift**: Use consistent date/time with timezone; maintain a single chronological basis.
- **Jurisdiction scope**: List all jurisdictions implicated by affected individuals, not just HQ location.
- **Unverified citations**: Mark uncertain legal citations or deadlines with `[VERIFY]`.
- **Privilege leaks**: Keep privileged content in clearly marked sections per counsel direction.
- **Vague counts**: Use ranges when scope is uncertain and explain the estimation basis.
