# Data Retention and Destruction Policy

Generates a firm-wide records management policy governing client file lifecycles, retention periods by practice area, secure destruction methods, legal holds, and audit requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Firm profile — practice areas, office locations, jurisdictions
- Current systems — DMS, cloud storage, email, backup infrastructure
- State bar rules — jurisdiction-specific ethics rules on client files
- Existing policies — information security, conflicts, client intake
- Vendors — certified document destruction services in use

## Quick Start

1. Gather firm profile and current systems inventory
2. Map applicable regulatory authorities to practice areas
3. Draft retention schedule by record category
4. Define destruction procedures (paper + electronic)
5. Establish legal hold protocol
6. Assign roles and build audit/training infrastructure

## Workflow

### 1. Regulatory Framework

Cite applicable authorities in the policy introduction:

| Authority | Applicability |
|---|---|
| ABA Model Rules 1.6, 1.15 | Confidentiality; safekeeping client property |
| State ethics rules | Jurisdiction-specific mandates (controls where more stringent) |
| Sarbanes-Oxley | Securities-related matters |
| HIPAA | Health law practices |
| IRS / IRC § 6001 | Tax work; 7-year documentation standard |

### 2. Scope

**Covered:** Client matter files, financial records (trust ledgers, billing), intake records (conflict databases, engagement letters), electronic records (email, cloud, mobile, backups), third-party collaboration platforms.

**Excluded:** Original client-owned documents (wills, deeds, certificates) — return on matter close; destruction requires written client authorization. Transitory communications (scheduling, duplicates) — delete promptly.

**Bound parties:** All firm personnel and third-party providers under confidentiality agreements.

### 3. Retention Schedule

| Record Category | Minimum Retention | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| General litigation / transactional | 6 yrs post-close | Malpractice SOL + margin |
| Estate planning | Permanent or client death + admin + SOL | Latent claim risk |
| Real estate | 7–10 yrs post-close | Title / environmental latency |
| Corporate formation / governance | Entity life + 7 yrs post-dissolution | Ongoing relevance |
| Tax preparation | 7 yrs post-filing | IRS extended audit period |
| Trust account records | 6 yrs or state bar rule (whichever longer) | Ethics rules |
| Firm accounting | 7 yrs | Tax audit exposure |
| Conflict / intake records | Duration of firm operation | Ongoing screening |
| Destruction logs | 3 yrs | Compliance evidence |

> **Legal Hold Override:** Schedules suspend immediately upon reasonable anticipation of litigation, investigation, or bar proceedings. Require written hold notice (scope, reason, responsible personnel). Retention restarts from hold release, not original close.

### 4. Destruction Procedures

**Paper:** Cross-cut shredding ≥ DIN 66399 P-4. On-site or certified vendor with chain-of-custody and destruction certificates. No regular trash or unsecured recycling.

**Electronic:**

| Sensitivity | Method |
|---|---|
| Standard | Cryptographic erasure / multi-pass overwrite (NIST SP 800-88) |
| Highly sensitive | Degaussing (magnetic) or physical destruction |
| SSDs / flash | Cryptographic erasure or physical destruction (overwrite unreliable) |

OS deletion / recycle-bin emptying is **not** sufficient.

**Scope:** Local workstations, servers, cloud, email, mobile, all backup generations, removable media.

**Device retirement:** Full sanitization or physical destruction before any device leaves firm control. Factory reset is insufficient.

**Client notification:** Written notice when matter eligible for destruction → reasonable retrieval period → document authorization or non-response.

**Destruction log fields:** Date, record description/matter ID, method used, personnel who performed/supervised.

### 5. Roles

| Role | Duties |
|---|---|
| Records Management Officer | Policy admin, exception auth, hold coordination, audit oversight |
| Supervising Attorneys | Annual file review, retention auth, hold initiation |
| IT | Automated retention flags, secure deletion, backup compliance |
| Admin Staff | Physical destruction, log maintenance, client notifications |

### 6. Training

- **New hire:** Policy overview, confidentiality, records handling, non-compliance consequences
- **Annual refresher:** Updates, audit findings, best practices
- **Records staff:** Technical destruction methods, hold procedures
- All training documented with signed acknowledgments

### 7. Auditing

**Annual audit:** Sample closed files for timely destruction, verify log completeness, attempt recovery on destroyed electronic records, review hold documentation.

**Quarterly hold review:** Confirm trigger still active, narrow scope where possible, release promptly on resolution with written notice.

**Vendor oversight (annual):** Review certifications, insurance, security protocols; inspect destruction facilities; require contractual confidentiality, security, and indemnification.

**Incident reporting:** Immediate report to Compliance Officer for violations/breaches. No retaliation. Triggers: root cause investigation, client notification assessment, regulatory reporting, corrective measures.

### 8. Policy Maintenance

- Annual review by Records Management Officer + firm leadership
- Interim review on: statutory/ethics changes, new technology, significant breach
- Amendments communicated within 30 days, incorporated into training
- Maintain version history with effective dates and approval records

## Pitfalls

- **[VERIFY]** State bar trust account minimums (commonly 5–7 yrs; varies by jurisdiction) — state rules control where more stringent
- **[VERIFY]** Malpractice SOL and discovery rule before setting retention floors; adjust if jurisdiction exceeds 6-year baseline
- **No indefinite retention** — holding beyond policy without justification increases breach exposure
- **Metadata** — electronic destruction must cover embedded metadata, not just visible content
- **Cloud/SaaS** — confirm contractual deletion rights; obtain vendor deletion certifications
- **Backups** — must include all generations; omitting backups leaves data recoverable
- **Malpractice carve-out** — allow attorneys to flag closed matters for extended retention with written justification and RMO approval
