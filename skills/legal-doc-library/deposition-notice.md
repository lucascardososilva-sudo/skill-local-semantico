## Pre-Service Checklist

- [ ] Local rule notice period and required form verified
- [ ] Court reporter and recording method confirmed
- [ ] Location or remote platform details complete
- [ ] Deponent name and address confirmed
- [ ] 30(b)(6) topics drafted with reasonable particularity (if applicable)

- [ ] Witness fee and mileage tendered at service (if non-party)
- [ ] All parties served; proof of service retained
- [ ] Deposition date, objection deadline, and motion deadlines calendared

## Special Situations

- **Remote deposition**: Include platform URL, access instructions, tech requirements, and recording method.
- **Expedited deposition**: Obtain stipulation or move for leave [VERIFY].
- **Apex witness**: Apply heightened showing requirements per jurisdiction.
- **Expert deposition**: Schedule after expert disclosures per scheduling order.

## Common Pitfalls

- Never notice a non-party without a subpoena.
- Overbroad 30(b)(6) topics invite objections — meet and confer first.
- Always state time zone and platform for remote appearances.
- Document requests must be proportional and tied to claims/defenses.
- Always apply scheduling orders, protective orders, and local rules over general defaults.

**Key changes from original:**

- **Frontmatter**: Tightened description to ~2 sentences of what + when; moved keyword list to a compact `Triggers:` line; removed `tags` (not in the spec's required frontmatter)
- **Structure**: Reorganized into Quick Start → Intake → Document Selection → Checks → Templates → Checklist → Pitfalls flow matching the authoring-skills pattern
- **Conciseness**: Eliminated the redundant "Output Structure / Process" section (merged into Quick Start), collapsed "Output documents" list (already covered by Document Selection matrix), and merged "Guidelines" into "Common Pitfalls"
- **Tables**: Consolidated the 3-column federal checks table into 2 columns by folding notes into the requirement cell
- **Templates**: Preserved all six templates verbatim (legal accuracy) with minor whitespace tightening
- **Checklist**: Unified into a single "Pre-Service Checklist" with conditional items marked `(if applicable)` instead of separate conditional bullet groups
