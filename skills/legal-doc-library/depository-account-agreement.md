| Calculation method | Simple or compound |
| Compounding frequency | Daily / monthly / quarterly / annually |
| Balance method | Minimum daily / average daily / collected |
| Rate adjustment | Index/benchmark, advance notice period |

| Written explanation (no error) | Required; state right to request supporting documents |

- Disclose daily ATM withdrawal, POS, and online transfer limits

| Stop payment | Fee; 6-month duration; renewal |
| Dormancy / inactivity | Fee; trigger period |
| Early account closure | Fee; applicable window |

- Fee increases: 30 days' advance notice (verify state law for longer periods); continued use = acceptance

### 5. Account Ownership and General Terms

| Account closure | Depositor: any time (early fee if applicable); institution: 10–30 days' notice; immediate for fraud/illegal activity |

### 7. Execution and Acknowledgments

**Signature block:**

- [ ] Electronic banking security acknowledgment
- [ ] Debit card terms acceptance
- [ ] Online/mobile banking security procedure acceptance
- [ ] W-9 certification
- [ ] ESIGN Act / UETA compliance for electronic execution

## Guidelines

- **Reg DD APY**: must appear in close proximity to interest rate; use exact regulatory terminology
- **Reg E opt-in**: ATM/debit overdraft requires separate written consent — never bundle into general acceptance
- **Arbitration**: CFPB rulemaking historically volatile; verify enforceability in governing jurisdiction [VERIFY]
- **Processing order**: some states restrict largest-to-smallest; verify governing state law [VERIFY]
- **Federal benefit setoff**: prohibited against Social Security, VA, and other federal benefits under 31 CFR Part 212 [VERIFY applicable types]
- **Reg D savings limits**: federal enforcement of 6-transfer limit suspended; confirm institution's contractual policy
- **Escheatment**: varies by state (3–5 years); verify governing state's unclaimed property statute
- **Electronic disclosures**: Reg CC/E/DD may only be delivered electronically after ESIGN Act § 101(c) consent
- Cite regulations in Bluebook format; verify effective dates via CFPB, OCC, FDIC, or Federal Reserve sources
- All outputs require attorney review in the account's jurisdiction
