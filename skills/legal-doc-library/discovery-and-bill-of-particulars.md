# Demand for Discovery and Bill of Particulars

Drafts a court-ready pleading combining targeted discovery demands with a bill of particulars to force disclosure, narrow vague theories, and preserve an enforceable compliance record.

## Prerequisites

1. **Jurisdiction and court** — court, division/department, case number, local rules, standing filing/formatting orders
2. **Case posture** — criminal, civil, or hybrid; current procedural stage
3. **Case file** — charging document or complaint, prior pleadings, motions, stipulations, existing discovery responses
4. **Information gaps** — ambiguous allegations or missing disclosures blocking trial preparation
5. **Privilege constraints** — potential privilege categories and any protective-order limitations
6. **Enforcement posture** — preferred path: meet-and-confer, motion to compel, fee/sanction relief

If any prerequisite is missing, pause and ask — do not assume or fill gaps.

## Output Structure

### 1. Regime Selection

Identify the governing track before drafting:

| Track | Governing Rules | Baseline Deadline |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Criminal | Fed. R. Crim. P. 16; 7(f) + local rules | Local rule/time limit [VERIFY] |
| Federal civil | FRCP 26(b)(1), 26(e), 26(g), 33, 34, 36, 37 | 30 days from service [VERIFY] |
| State | State procedure + local rules | State-specific [VERIFY] |

### 2. Case Information Block

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Court | [jurisdiction] |
| Judge/department | [if required] |
| Plaintiff/Prosecution | [name] |
| Defendant | [name] |
| Case number | [xxxx] |
| Document title | Demand for Discovery and Bill of Particulars |
| Strategic objective | [narrow charges / obtain disclosure / prepare defenses] |

### 3. Authority and Need

- State party status, case stage, and necessity for relief
- Criminal: cite Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, 7(f) for disclosure and particularized charge notice
- Civil: cite FRCP 26(b)(1), 33, 34, 36, 37 for relevance, specificity, and sanctions path
- Include proportionality statement; affirm requests are not harassing or overbroad

### 4. Discovery Demands

Numbered requests with strict specificity:

| Req. | Category | Custodian/Source | Time Range | Format | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Documents/ESI | [party + affiliates] | [from/to] | Native + metadata | [defense use] |
| 2 | Communications | [emails/texts/notes] | [from/to] | Native + index | [defense use] |
| 3 | Witness IDs | [trial/public witnesses] | [if ongoing] | Contact + scope | Trial prep/notice |
| 4 | Expert materials | [experts] | [all] | CVs, reports, data, opinions | Rebuttal/cross prep |

- Manner and means for each offense
- Nexus to venue, elements, and defenses

**Civil particulars:**
- Statutory or contractual provisions breached and breach conduct
- Itemized damages per category with calculation basis

### 6. Compliance and Deadlines

- State response deadline and service method
- Require complete, verified responses per local/operative rules
- Require supplementation duty as new information becomes known
- Include escalation sequence: meet-and-confer → motion to compel → sanctions/preclusion/fee recovery

## Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance

- [ ] Governing rules identified for correct track (criminal / federal civil / state)
- [ ] Local captioning, formatting, and e-filing requirements followed
- [ ] Response deadlines verified against applicable rules — no invented dates
- [ ] Nomenclature matches jurisdiction (e.g., "demand" vs. "motion" vs. "request")
- [ ] Service method complies with local practice

## Guidelines

- Every request must map to a litigation purpose — no fishing expeditions
- Use parallel phrasing for criminal and civil tracks; never mix standards without citing the governing rule
- Separate factual requests from relief/remedy requests to reduce objections
- Avoid vague terms; include exact relief language to build an escalation-ready record
- Acknowledge privilege and nonparty constraints in each request where applicable
- Eliminate duplicate or mutually inconsistent requests
- Mark jurisdictional assumptions with `[VERIFY]` when local law is uncertain
- All citations must be verified — do not hallucinate rule numbers, deadlines, or case law

Key improvements from the original:

- **Frontmatter description** rewritten in third-person with clearer trigger guidance
- **Prerequisites** now use bold labels with dash separators matching codebase convention; added the "pause and ask" instruction
- **Regime selection** condensed from a 5-column matrix to a focused 3-column table
- **Case information** converted from a code block to a proper table
- **"Final control checks"** section (step 8) removed — those checks are now folded into a dedicated **Jurisdiction-Specific Compliance** checklist section with checkboxes, matching the pattern used by `abstract-of-judgment` and `alibi-notice`
- **Certification block** fixed the "harrasment" typo
- **Guidelines** tightened to 8 focused bullets with an added hallucination guard
- Overall ~20% shorter while preserving all legal substance
