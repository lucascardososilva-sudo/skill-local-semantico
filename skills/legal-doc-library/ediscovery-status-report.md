# E-Discovery Status Report

Produces an attorney-work-product status report tracking ESI from collection through review for U.S. commercial litigation.

## Prerequisites

Gather before starting. Flag and caveat any gaps in the report.

1. **Vendor collection logs** — custodian names, item counts, GB volumes, file types, processing status
2. **Review platform exports** — document counts, reviewer IDs, coding dates, relevance/privilege/issue-tag designations
3. **Search term results** — hit counts per query, precision/validation sampling data if available
4. **Privilege log drafts** — finalized privilege assertions with custodian and document-type breakdowns

## Quick Start

1. Normalize custodian names across all sources into a single canonical list
2. Populate each report section using the templates below
3. Surface flags and anomalies at each stage
4. Mark final output: **ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT — PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL**

## Report Sections

### 1. Executive Summary

- Collection completeness status
- Search strategy effectiveness (one sentence)
- Review progress % and projected completion date
- Critical issues requiring immediate action

### 2. Collection Metrics by Custodian

| Custodian | GB Collected | Items | Email % | Office Doc % | Other % | Processing Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| [Name] | [X.X] | [N] | [X%] | [X%] | [X%] | Complete / Pending / Error |

**Flags:**
- Volume >2× matter average → possible over-collection or key player
- Unexpectedly low volume → incomplete collection risk
- Processing error rate >5% by custodian or file type

**Validation:** Collected ≥ Processed ≥ Loaded ≥ Reviewed. Explain any downward discrepancy.

### 3. Search Term Performance

| Search Term / Boolean | Hits | Hit Rate (%) | Precision (if sampled) | Status |
|----------------------|------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| [Term] | [N] | [X%] | [X%] | Keep / Refine / Drop |

**Flags:**
- Hit rate >30% → likely overbroad
- Hit rate <0.5% → likely underperforming
- High inter-term overlap → recommend consolidation
- If precision data exists, project relevant yield from unreviewed hits

### 4. Review Progress

| Metric | Count | % of Loaded |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Loaded to platform | [N] | 100% |
| Reviewed | [N] | [X%] |
| Coded Relevant | [N] | [X%] |
| Coded Privileged | [N] | [X%] |
| Coded Non-Responsive | [N] | [X%] |
| Remaining | [N] | [X%] |

**Reviewer Productivity:**

| Reviewer | Docs Reviewed | Avg Docs/Hr | Relevance Rate | Privilege Rate |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| [Name] | [N] | [X] | [X%] | [X%] |

- Flag coding patterns >15% above/below team average (QC concern)
- Note velocity trend: accelerating / decelerating / stable (weekly rolling avg)
- **Projected completion:** [Date] at [N] docs/day — state assumptions explicitly

### 5. Privilege Analysis

| Custodian | Docs Reviewed | Privilege Assertions | Privilege Rate |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| [Name] | [N] | [N] | [X%] |

- Note whether overall privilege rate is within expected range for matter type
- Break down privilege rate by document type (email vs. office docs vs. other)
- Flag custodians with rates >2× matter average for senior attorney QC

### 6. Recommendations & Timeline

- **Resource needs:** additional reviewers / vendor remediation / search refinement
- **Search adjustments:** specific terms to modify
- **QC actions:** reviewer-specific or category-specific
- **Risk items:** gaps, processing failures, tight deadlines
- **Milestones:** processing complete, first-pass review complete, privilege log ready (with dates)

## Pitfalls

- **Privilege substance leaks** — present privilege statistics in aggregate only; never reveal communication substance or attorney mental impressions
- **Adverse findings** — report collection gaps, QC failures, and search weaknesses without minimization so counsel can make informed decisions
- **Missing audit trail** — document how discrepancies were resolved and what validation steps were taken; the process may be challenged
- **Unstated assumptions** — all projections must explicitly state their underlying assumptions
- **Distribution control** — limit report distribution to litigation team members with case management need
