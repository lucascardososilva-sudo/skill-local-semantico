# Employee Dispute Summary

Produce an objective, source-cited summary of an employee dispute for HR and legal decision-making.

## Quick Start

Collect before drafting:
- **Source corpus** — complaints, witness statements, investigation reports, correspondence, disciplinary records, employment agreements, policies/handbooks, performance reviews, agency filings, pleadings, settlement docs
- **Parties** — all individuals/entities with roles and relationships
- **Timeline anchors** — key dates, deadlines, hearings, milestones
- **Forum** — internal process, arbitration, EEOC/state agency, court, union grievance
- **Resolution docs** — settlement, award, or decision documents (if any)

## Output Sections

### 11. Gaps / Additional Information Needed

## Source Handling

- Tag every factual assertion with a marker: `[Doc-12]`.
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes; cite document and page/section.
- If a fact is disputed, state both positions and label **Disputed**.

## Pitfalls and Checks

- **Neutrality** — never assess credibility or intent; state legal conclusions only if formally determined by a court, arbitrator, or agency.
- **Policy versions** — identify the governing policy version and effective date when cited.
- **Privilege** — note confidentiality restrictions; do not reproduce sensitive material beyond necessity.
- **Jurisdiction** — if unclear or non-U.S., flag explicitly and adjust labels; mark uncertain citations `[VERIFY]`.
- **Retaliation / preservation** — highlight anti-retaliation and document-preservation obligations when implicated.
- **Length** — target 2–5 pages for complex matters; keep scannable.
