# Estate Administration Summary

## Pitfalls & Checks

- **No legal opinions.** Use neutral, factual language throughout.
- **"As of" qualifiers.** Every amount and date must state its reference date and cite the source.
- **Do not infer deadlines or priority rules.** If not documented, mark `UNKNOWN` and flag as state-specific.
- **Conflicting data.** Only reconcile when the source hierarchy is explicit; otherwise present both values and note the conflict.
- **Redact PII.** Mask SSNs, full account numbers, and other sensitive identifiers.
- **Unverified citations.** Tag with `[VERIFY]`.
- **Jurisdiction terminology.** Use probate terms consistent with the governing state's courts.
