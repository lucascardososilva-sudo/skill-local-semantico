## Pitfalls & Checks

- Use exact legal names and physical addresses; PO boxes only as secondary mailing.
- Document all "reasonable efforts" and declinations with dates.
- Trusted contact is informational only — never imply trading authority.
- Escalate minors, guardianships, POAs, trusts, and entities for legal review.
- Follow firm WSPs for CIP, AML, OFAC screening, and supervisory sign-off.
- Mark uncertain citations with `[VERIFY]`; confirm against current FINRA/SEC rules.
- U.S. jurisdiction only; note deviations for non-U.S. customers.
