# Professional Fundraiser Contract Compliance Check

Produces a structured compliance audit that classifies each fundraising relationship, verifies registrations, extracts disclosure data, and maps contract clauses against state-mandated requirements.

## Prerequisites

1. **States in scope** — where the charity is registered and/or solicits
2. **Contract documents** — executed agreements, amendments, SOWs, exhibits, fee schedules
3. **Filing target(s)** — annual report/renewal, campaign notice, co-venturer filing
4. **Operational artifacts** — donation flow diagrams, processor agreements, bank deposit controls (if available)
5. **Registration IDs** — fundraiser/solicitor/co-venturer and charity registration numbers per state (if known)
6. **Solicitation start date** — needed for Notice of Intent / contract filing deadlines

If inputs are missing, apply defaults: all registered states; annual report/renewal target; highest-risk classification until clarified. Mark gaps in "Open Items / Needed Inputs."

## Output Structure

### 1. Classify Relationship and Verify Registration

| Type | Key Markers | Regulatory Burden |
|---|---|---|
| **Professional Solicitor** | Directly solicits donations; may handle funds, donor data, scripts | Highest — registration, contract filing, campaign reporting, point-of-solicitation disclosures |
| **Fundraising Counsel** | Advises/manages campaigns; does NOT solicit or take custody of funds | Moderate — reclassified as solicitor if counsel solicits or takes custody |
| **Commercial Co-Venturer** | Ties purchase/use of goods to charitable benefit ("$1 per sale goes to X") | Advertising disclosures (benefit amount, duration, charity ID) and accounting |
| **Platform / Processor / Vendor** | Donation platform, payment processor, influencer/affiliate | May become solicitor or co-venturer depending on marketing claims and solicitation control |

> If classification is ambiguous, treat as highest-risk category until clarified by counsel.

**Registration verification** — for each vendor × state, extract and verify against state registry:

| Data Point | Verification Source |
|---|---|
| Legal name, DBA, address | State registry |
| Entity type, state of formation | Secretary of State DB |
| Registration No. (per state) | State DB (e.g., NY FR-No, CA CT-No) |
| Bond posted (if required) | State bond registry |
| Charity's own registration | State DB |

### 2. Extract Contract Data

Complete one row per **vendor × campaign × contract/SOW**:

| Category | Fields to Extract |
|---|---|
| **Parties** | Legal names, addresses, entity types |
| **Classification** | Solicitor / counsel / co-venturer / other |
| **Campaign** | Name/ID, dates, services, whether "solicitation" occurs |
| **Compensation** | Type (%, flat, retainer, per-call, CPM); percentage + base (gross vs. net); minimums/guarantees; expense allocations |
| **Custody of Funds** | Who receives funds first; deposit method; deposit/remittance timing; segregation; deductions before remittance |
| **Other Terms** | Charity name/logo use; donor data ownership; records/inspection rights; script approval; filing responsibilities; cancellation rights; subcontractors |

**Funds flow** — document for each arrangement: donor payment methods, intake entity, processor merchant of record, deposit account owner/type, deposit and remittance timing, deductions, reconciliation controls.

Funds-flow red flags:
- Vendor receives checks payable to vendor (not charity)
- Commingled accounts or no segregation of charitable funds
- Remittance timing unstated
- Charity lacks bank-view or reconciliation rights

### 3. Mandated-Clause Compliance Audit

**G. Registration & Filings**
- [ ] Vendor represents current registration/licensing
- [ ] Registration numbers and renewal evidence required
- [ ] Responsibility for state filings/notices allocated
- [ ] Pre-solicitation filing deadlines referenced (commonly 10–20 days before start)

**I. Data & Privacy**

**State-specific matrix** — populate per state in scope:

| State | Statute [VERIFY] | Cancellation Right | Financial Report Deadline | Required Filings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CA | Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17510+ | | | CT-1/CT-2 series |
| NY | Exec. Law Art. 7-A; 13 NYCRR Part 91 | | | CHAR007 |

## Guidelines

- Charitable solicitation regulation is **state-based** — requirements differ significantly by state and classification. Always verify current statutes; these laws are frequently amended.
- If classification is unclear or mixed, default to highest-risk category.
- If only a master agreement is available, treat missing SOWs/amendments as compliance risks.
- Confirm exact form field names per state (CA RRF-1/CT-2CF, NY CHAR500/CHAR007, Form 990 Schedule G).
- Pre-solicitation filing deadlines (Notices of Intent, contract filings) are commonly 10–20 days before campaign start — check per state.
- Every classification must be supported by contract language and operational evidence.
- Compensation base (gross vs. net) must be clearly identified and consistently applied.
- Disclosure narratives must match extracted data and be internally consistent.
- Mark all uncertain citations or requirements with [VERIFY].
- After delivering the audit, confirm: (1) classification matches the user's understanding of each vendor's role, (2) no additional contracts/amendments are outstanding, (3) whether additional state narratives are needed, (4) whether funds-flow concerns require escalation.
- This workflow supports legal and compliance review — it is not legal advice.
