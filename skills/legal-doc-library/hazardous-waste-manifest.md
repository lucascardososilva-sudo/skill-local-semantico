# Hazardous Waste Manifest (EPA Form 8700-22)

Drafts a RCRA-compliant Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest establishing chain of custody from generation through final disposal.

## Prerequisites

1. **Generator EPA ID** — 40 CFR Part 262 registration; physical site address
2. **Transporter records** — EPA ID, DOT registration, permit status per carrier
3. **TSDF authorization** — facility EPA ID, state permits confirming acceptance of waste type/quantity
4. **Waste characterization** — DOT proper shipping name, EPA waste codes (40 CFR Part 261), quantity, container count/type, hazard class, packing group
5. **Emergency contact** — 24-hour number (CHEMTREC or company line)

## Output Structure

### 1. Generator Information

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Legal business name | Full legal name |
| Generation site address | Physical (not mailing) |
| EPA ID number | 40 CFR Part 262 |
| Primary contact phone | Business hours |
| 24-hour emergency contact | Required for transport incidents |

### 2. Transporter Information *(repeat per carrier)*

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Company legal name | As registered with EPA |
| EPA ID number | 40 CFR Part 263 |
| DOT registration number | 49 CFR Parts 171–180 |
| Signature/date block | Custody receipt acknowledgment |

### 3. Designated Facility (TSDF)

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Facility legal name | As permitted |
| EPA ID number | Current registration |
| State permit numbers | DTSC or equivalent state authority |
| Permitted waste types | Must align with manifest waste codes |

> Verify TSDF authorization for specific waste type/quantity and LDR treatment standard compliance before designating.

### 4. Waste Description

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| DOT proper shipping name | 49 CFR Part 172 |
| EPA hazardous waste codes | Four-digit codes, 40 CFR Part 261 |
| Quantity | Weight AND volume |
| Container type and count | DOT-approved specs |
| Physical/chemical form | Solid, liquid, sludge, etc. |
| Hazard class / packing group | DOT classification |
| Special handling | If applicable |

### 5. Certifications

- **Emergency number**: CHEMTREC (1-800-424-9300) or company line
- **Generator certification** (verbatim per 40 CFR 262.23):

```
I hereby declare that the contents of this consignment are fully and
accurately described above by the proper shipping name, and are classified,
packed, marked and labeled/placarded, and are in all respects in proper
condition for transport according to applicable international and national
governmental regulations. If export shipment and I am the Primary Exporter,
I certify that the contents of this consignment conform to the terms of the
attached EPA Acknowledgment of Consent.
```

- Include waste minimization certification: volume/toxicity reduction program in place, disposal method minimizes health/environmental threats

### 6. Signatures & Discrepancy Reporting

Signature chain: generator representative → each transporter → receiving facility operator (each with date)

Discrepancy fields per **40 CFR 264.72 / 265.72**:
- [ ] Quantity variation (significant vs. non-significant)
- [ ] Container damage or count mismatch
- [ ] Waste type or description discrepancy
- [ ] Unacceptable waste notation
- [ ] Facility irregularity documentation

### 7. Copy Distribution

1. Generator retained copy
2. One copy per transporter
3. Designated facility (TSDF)
4. Return copy to generator as delivery/disposal proof

## Guidelines

- Final document must conform to EPA Uniform Manifest format (40 CFR Part 262, Subpart B)
- **State overlays**: CA, NY, and others require state-specific forms or additional fields — check state environmental agency requirements
- **Multi-transporter**: each carrier needs a separate signed acknowledgment block; verify current EPA and DOT credentials
- **LDR**: confirm TSDF is authorized for applicable land disposal restriction treatment standards
- **Discrepancy threshold**: significant quantity discrepancies trigger EPA regional office notification — flag for attorney review
- **Retention**: generator must retain copies minimum 3 years per 40 CFR 262.40 [VERIFY against recent RCRA amendments]
