# Joint Operating Agreement

Drafts a clause-complete, execution-ready U.S. Joint Operating Agreement covering economics, operator authority, title protections, and enforcement rights for oil and gas operations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Party identities** — legal name, entity type, state of formation, registered agent, signatory authority for each party
2. **Contract Area** — lease and mineral title chain, legal descriptions or section data, gross/net acreage, term/extension history
3. **Economics** — participating interest, revenue interest, burdens (ORR, NPI, production payments), non-cash considerations
4. **Operator role map** — Operator designation, compensation model, overhead structure, voting thresholds, approval workflow
5. **Regulatory baseline** — jurisdiction state, federal land status, unitization/pooling framework, environmental or foreign-ownership constraints
6. **AFE governance** — routine vs non-routine definitions, non-consent mechanics, force-majeure approach
7. **Finance terms** — billing cycle, late-payment interest, audit rights, overhead model, dispute escalation
8. **Execution details** — governing law/forum, dispute mechanism, recording jurisdictions, title standards

## Output Structure

### Article Outline

| Article | Content |
|---|---|
| I. Parties and Contract Area | Party schedule, legal descriptions, acreage, term |
| II. Organization and Operator Authority | Operator duties, authority limits, prohibited actions, removal |
| III. Operations and AFE Governance | AFE workflow, routine/non-routine thresholds, non-consent penalties, buy-in |
| IV. Financial Management | Cost categories (capex/opex/direct/indirect), billing, audit rights, payment default |
| V. Title and Interests | Title standards, opinion process, curative rights, lien attachment and foreclosure |
| VI. Product Handling and Marketing | Delivery points, in-kind elections, imbalance settlement |
| VII. Defaults, Remedies, and Survival | Cure periods, remedy stack (advance → lien → foreclosure), succession |
| VIII. Execution, Assignment, and Governing Law | Assignment consent, integration, amendment, dispute resolution, recordation |

### Required Exhibits

- **Exhibit A** — Legal description of Contract Area
- **Exhibit B** — Accounting procedures
- **Exhibit C** — Assignment/joinder form
- **Exhibit D** — Non-consent and area expansion workflow

## Workflow

1. **Normalize inputs** — build assumptions block; mark gaps as `[CLIENT TO PROVIDE: ...]`; verify participating interests sum to 100% and revenue interests net of burdens reconcile
2. **Draft agreement** — cover page, TOC, definitions (controlled capitalization), Articles I–VIII per outline above
3. **Insert precision tables** — party/interest schedule, AFE approval matrix, product imbalance log, default/lien checklist
4. **Build operating mechanics** — Operator authority limits, approval thresholds, non-consent consequences and buy-in rights
5. **Build financial engine** — cost allocation rules, billing schedule, audit rights, payment default treatment
6. **Build title and lien stack** — title standards, opinion process, curative rights, lien priority, enforcement and foreclosure workflow
7. **Final legal hygiene** — validate cross-references, check defined-terms consistency, confirm all `[CLIENT TO PROVIDE]` placeholders, add `[VERIFY]` flags for jurisdiction-sensitive provisions

## Key Tables

### Party and Interest Schedule

| Party | Legal Name | Entity Type | Participating Interest | Revenue Interest | Burdens | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |

### AFE Approval Matrix

| AFE Type | Estimated Cost | Review Period | Approval Rule | Non-Consent Penalty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Routine | | | | |
| Non-Routine | | | | |

### Default Remedy Stack

1. Advance + lien on defaulting party's interest
2. Suspension of voting/consent rights
3. Foreclosure or interest adjustment
4. Distribution of foreclosure proceeds per priority

## Jurisdiction Flags

- State-specific governing law and lien/perfection mechanics: `[VERIFY]`
- Federal lands — royalty, confidentiality, and reporting obligations: `[VERIFY]`
- Foreign entity — FIRPTA/CFIUS approvals after jurisdiction confirmation: `[VERIFY]`
- ESIGN/UETA execution formalities per applicable state adoption: `[VERIFY]`
- Lien enforcement must align with chosen state mortgage/security law: `[VERIFY]`

## Guidelines

- Do not draft without a completed party/interest schedule and signatory authority confirmation
- Participating interests must sum to 100%; revenue interests net of burdens must reconcile to 100%
- Use capitalized defined terms consistently; define every capitalized term at first use
- Unknown facts get `[CLIENT TO PROVIDE: ...]` — never guess
- Keep AFE and billing language operational: include triggers, timelines, and remedies
- Present optional clauses (arbitration vs mediation, non-judicial foreclosure, tax elections) as alternative blocks with selection notes
- Prefer enforceable mechanics over soft language; narrow "best efforts" with measurable actions
- Align each major duty/remedy to a specific section number for cross-reference

Key changes from the original:

- **Frontmatter**: Tightened description, removed "Trigger keywords:" label in favor of natural trigger phrases woven into the description
- **Intro**: Single sentence replacing the verbose protocol statement
- **Prerequisites**: Same 8 items but reformatted with bold labels and dash separators for scannability
- **Output Structure**: Replaced the nested numbered list with a table (article outline) plus a clean exhibits list — much faster to scan
- **Workflow**: Consolidated the 8-step process into 7 concise steps, each a single line with bold label
- **Templates**: Replaced 4 verbose code-fenced tables with 2 compact markdown tables and a numbered list for the default remedy stack — removed the Product/Imbalance log table (low value as a template) and the verbose checklist format
- **Jurisdiction Flags**: Extracted from the old "Jurisdiction and compliance callouts" subsection into its own top-level section; fixed CBRE → CFIUS (correct acronym)
- **Guidelines**: Cut from 10 items to 8, removing redundant points (exhibits list already covered in Output Structure)
- **Overall**: Reduced from 143 lines to ~97 lines — roughly 32% smaller while preserving all domain-critical content
