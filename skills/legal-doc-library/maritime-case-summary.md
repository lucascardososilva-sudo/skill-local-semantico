# Maritime Case Summary

Generates structured analytical summaries of maritime law cases from uploaded judicial opinions, pleadings, or briefs.

## Quick Start

1. Receive case materials (opinion, pleadings, or briefs)
2. Identify case type: collision/allision, cargo damage, personal injury, charter party, lien enforcement, salvage, limitation of liability, or jurisdictional challenge
3. Produce summary following the section order below

## Summary Sections

### 1. Case Caption & Citation

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Case name | Full caption |
| Citation | Bluebook format [VERIFY all citations] |
| Court | Including circuit/district |
| Date | Date of decision |
| Maritime subject | Primary area (e.g., collision, cargo, Jones Act) |

### 2. Procedural Posture

- Litigation stage and specific motion/appeal
- Admiralty vs. diversity jurisdiction (note significance)

### 3. Factual Background

- Vessel name(s), type, flag state
- Parties and roles (owner, charterer, shipper, cargo interest, seafarer)
- Date, location, jurisdictional waters
- Weather/sea conditions if relevant
- Chronological sequence of events
- Monetary amounts in dispute

### 4. Legal Issues

Frame each issue using maritime doctrine. Common categories:

| Domain | Key Questions |
|--------|--------------|
| Jurisdiction | Location test + nexus test; Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act |
| Choice of law | General maritime law vs. state law; foreign-flag analysis |
| Collision/allision | Fault allocation under Navigation Rules; Reliable Transfer comparative fault |
| Liability limits | Limitation of Liability Act applicability |
| Contract | Charter party/bill of lading; Hague-Visby Rules, Hamburg Rules |
| Personal injury | Jones Act, LHWCA, or general maritime law; seaman status |
| Liens | Maritime lien priority and enforcement |
| Salvage | Voluntary service, danger, success elements |
| Economic loss | Robins Dry Dock rule |
| Environmental | OPA 90, CWA liability |
| International | UNCLOS, applicable conventions |

Summarize each party's position. Note circuit splits or novel questions.

### 5. Holding & Reasoning

- Resolution of each identified issue
- Maritime doctrines applied (name each doctrine)
- Statutory/regulatory provisions cited
- Treatment of international conventions
- Dissents signaling future challenges

### 6. Practical Implications

- Impact on vessel owners, charterers, cargo interests, insurers, seafarers
- New precedent or clarification of unsettled law
- Operational guidance from the ruling

## Terminology & Style Checks

- Use "vessel" not "boat"; "collision" (two moving vessels) vs. "allision" (vessel strikes fixed object)
- Distinguish "charterer" vs. "shipper"; use "seaman"/"seafarer" not generic terms
- Distinguish property damage, personal injury, economic loss, and environmental damages
- For technical terms (general average, demurrage, deviation, salvage), include a one-line definition for non-specialist readers
- Bluebook citations; mark unverified citations with [VERIFY]
- Always note whether admiralty jurisdiction was contested and how resolved

**Key changes made:**

- **Removed `tags`** from frontmatter (not part of the spec — only `name` and `description` are standard)
- **Tightened description** — shorter while preserving all trigger keywords
- **Added Quick Start** section for immediate orientation
- **Flattened structure** — removed the "Prerequisites" and "Output Structure" wrapper headings; sections now flow directly under "Summary Sections"
- **Trimmed prose** throughout — removed redundant phrasing in procedural posture, factual background, and holding sections
- **Consolidated Guidelines into "Terminology & Style Checks"** — shorter heading, bullet-only format, removed the verbose "Scope" and standalone "Jurisdiction flags" bullets by integrating them
- **Reduced from 90 lines to ~75** while preserving all domain-accurate legal content and the complete doctrine reference table
