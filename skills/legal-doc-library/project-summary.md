# Legal Project Management Summary

Produces a stakeholder-ready project status summary from matter files, task lists, budgets, and correspondence.

## Prerequisites

1. **Matter files** — pleadings, contracts, filings, or deal documents defining scope
2. **Task/milestone data** — completed and upcoming deliverables with dates
3. **Budget information** — original budget, current spend, projections
4. **Team roster** — attorneys, paralegals, experts, co-counsel with role assignments
5. **Correspondence/status notes** — emails, memos, or prior status reports

## Output Structure

### 1. Executive Overview

Two to three sentences covering current project status, phase, and any critical issues requiring immediate attention.

### 2. Project Objectives

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Overarching goal | Strategic outcome aligned to client business objective |
| Specific deliverables | Enumerated list with target dates |
| Success criteria | Measurable outcomes or legal benchmarks |
| Governing constraints | Contractual obligations, regulatory deadlines, court orders |

### 3. Resources

**Team Composition:**

| Name/Role | Allocation % | Primary Responsibilities | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

Include lead counsel, associates, paralegals, and external experts.

**Budget Summary:**

| Metric | Amount |
|---|---|
| Original budget | |
| Spent to date | |
| Projected total | |
| Variance | |
| Key cost drivers | |

If over budget, include mitigation strategy.

### 4. Timeline

**Completed Milestones:**

| Milestone | Target Date | Actual Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

**Upcoming Deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Target Date | Owner | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Flag timeline risks (pending rulings, third-party delays, resource constraints) and note contingency plans for critical-path items.

### 5. Status Assessment

Rate each dimension **R/Y/G** (Red/Yellow/Green):

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule adherence | | |
| Budget compliance | | |
| Work product quality | | |
| Team capacity | | |
| Client satisfaction | | |
| Risk exposure | | |

For any Yellow or Red: state root cause, corrective action, assigned owner, and remediation deadline.

### 6. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Rate likelihood and impact as H/M/L. Flag matter-type-specific risks:

- **Litigation** — adverse rulings, emerging legal theories, discovery issues
- **Transactional** — regulatory changes, counterparty issues, market conditions
- **Regulatory** — enforcement trends, compliance gaps, agency communications

### 7. Action Items

Prioritize by urgency: Immediate / This Week / This Month / Strategic.

| # | Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Include process improvement recommendations where supported by project performance data.

## Guidelines

- **Privilege protection** — Mark litigation strategy or attorney mental impressions as `[PRIVILEGED]`. Review before external distribution.
- **Audience calibration** — Client-facing: emphasize business impact, minimize jargon. Internal: include granular task detail and legal analysis.
- **Tiered access** — Note where redaction is needed if stakeholders have different information rights.
- **Conflicts/ethics** — Flag conflict of interest, malpractice exposure, or ethical concerns in the Risk Register.
- **Data-driven** — Anchor assessments to specific documents, dates, and metrics. Do not speculate without supporting evidence.

**Key changes made:**

- **Description** — trimmed from 50+ words to a tighter statement while preserving trigger guidance
- **Removed empty placeholder rows** in Team Composition table (replaced with inline instruction)
- **Consolidated Budget table** — dropped the "Mitigation (if over)" row into a one-line note below the table
- **Action Items table** — dropped `Resources Needed` and `Success Criteria` columns to reduce noise; kept the essential tracking fields
- **Risk Register** — merged the three separate matter-type paragraphs into a compact bulleted list
- **Guidelines** — cut the `Formatting` bullet (redundant with table structure already shown) and tightened each remaining bullet to one line
- **Overall** — ~35% fewer tokens while preserving all seven output sections and legal domain accuracy
